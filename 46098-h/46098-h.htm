<h2>I<br />
<small>IN SEARCH OF THE REVOLUTION</small></h2>


<p>In the month of August of the year 1792
the Rue Maugout was a distorted cleft in
the gray mass of the Faubourg St. Antoine,
apart from the ceaseless cry of life of the thoroughfare,
but animated by a sprinkling of
shops and taverns. No. 38, like its neighbors,
was a twisted, settled mass of stone and timber
that had somehow held together from the time
of Henry II. The entrance was low, pinched,
and dank. On one side a twisted staircase zig-zagged
into the gloom. On the other a squat
door with a grating in the center, like a blind
eye, led into the cellar which la Mère Corniche,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>the concierge, let out at two sous a night to travelers
in search of an economical resting-place.
Beyond this rat-hole a murky glass served as a
peep-hole, whence her flattened nose and little
eyes could dimly be distinguished at all hours of
the day. This tenebrous entrance, after plunging
onward some forty feet, fell against a wall of
gray light, where the visitor, making an abrupt
angle, passed into the purer air of a narrow court.
Opposite, the passage took up its interrupted
way to a farther court, more spacious, where a
dirt-colored maple offered a ragged shelter and a
few parched vines gripped the yellow walls.
The tiled roofs were shrunk, the ridges warped,
the walls cracking and bulging about the distorted
windows. Along the roofs the dust and
dirt had gradually accumulated and given birth
to a few blades of gray-green plants. Nature
had slipped in and assimilated the work of man,
until the building, yielding to the weight of
time and the elements, appeared as a hollow
sunk in fantastic cliffs, where, from narrow, misshapen
slits, the dwellers peered forth. About
the maple swarmed a troop of children, grimy,
bare, and voluble. In the branches and in the
ivy a horde of sparrows shrilled and fought,
keeping warily out of reach of the lank cats
that slunk in ambush.</p>

<p>In front of No. 38, each morning, prompt as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>the sun, which she often anticipated, la Mère
Corniche appeared with her broom. She was
one of those strange old women in whom the
appearances of youth and age are incongruously
blended. Seen from behind, her short, erect
stature (she was an equal four feet), her skirt
stopping half-way below the knees to reveal a
pair of man's boots, gave the effect of a child of
twelve. When she turned, the shock of the
empty gums, the skin hanging in pockets on
the cheeks, the eyes showing from their pouches
like cold lanterns, caused her to seem like a
being who had never known youth.</p>

<p>She had thrown open the doors on this August
morning and was conducting a resolute campaign
with her broom when she perceived a young man,
who even at that early hour, from the evidence
of dust, had just completed an arduous journey.
A bulging handkerchief swinging from a staff
across his shoulder evidently contained all his
baggage, and proclaimed the definite purpose of
the immigrant. The concierge regarded him
with some curiosity. He was too old to be a
truant scholar, and too much at ease to be of the
far provinces. Besides, his dress showed familiarity
with the city modes. He seemed
rather the young adventurer running to Paris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>in the first flush of that enthusiasm and attraction
which the Revolution in its influx had
awakened.</p>

<p>The dress itself proclaimed, not without a
touch of humor, the preparation of the zealous
devotee approaching the Mecca of his ambitions.
His cocked hat, of a largeness which
suggested another owner, was new and worn
jauntily, with the gay assurance of youth in its
destiny. A brilliant red neck-cloth was arranged
with the abandon of pardonable vanity. A clear
blue redingote, a cloth-of-gold vest, and a pair of
drab knickerbockers completed a costume that
had drawn many a smile. For while the coat
was so long that the sleeves hid the wrist, the
vest was bursting its buttons, and though the
knickerbockers pinched, the hat continued to
wobble in dumb accusation; so that two generations
at least must have contributed to the
wardrobe of the young buccaneer.</p>

<p>At the moment the concierge discovered the
youthful adventurer, he was engrossed in the
task of slapping the dust from his garments,
while his eyes, wandering along the streets, were
searching to some purpose.</p>

<p>Curiosity being stronger than need, it was
la Mère Corniche who put the first question.</p>

<p>"Well, citoyen, you seek some one in this
street?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>"The answer should be apparent," the young
fellow answered frankly. "I seek a lodging.
Have you a room to let?"</p>

<p>"H'm!" La Mère Corniche eyed him unfavorably.
"Maybe I have, and maybe I haven't;
I take no aristocrats."</p>

<p>The young man, seeing that his clothes were
in disfavor, began to laugh.</p>

<p>"In as far, citoyenne," he said, with a sweep
of his hand, "as it concerns these, I plead guilty:
my clothes are aristocrats. But hear me," as his
listener began to scowl. "They were; but aristocrats
being traitors, I confiscated them; and,"
he added slyly, "I come to deliver them to the
State."</p>

<p>"And to denounce the traitors, citoyen," the
concierge exclaimed fiercely, "even were they
your father and mother."</p>

<p>"Even that&mdash;if I had a family," he added
cautiously. "And now, citoyenne, what can
you do for me?"</p>

<p>With this direct question, the fanatic light in
her face died away. The little woman withdrew
a step and ran her eyes over the prospective
tenant. She made him repeat the question,
and finally said, with a sigh, as though regretting
the price she had fixed in her mind, "How
long?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<p>"A year&mdash;two years&mdash;indefinitely."</p>

<p>"There are two rooms and a parlor on the
second," she began tentatively.</p>

<p>"That suits me."</p>

<p>"The price will be for you&mdash;" la Mère Corniche
hastened to increase the sum, "thirty
francs a month."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>"Payable in advance."</p>

<p>The young fellow shrugged his shoulders, and
with a comical grin turned his pockets inside out.</p>

<p>"What!" la Mère Corniche shrieked in
her astonishment. "You swindler! You have
taken an apartment at thirty francs a month
without a sou in your pocket."</p>

<p>"At present."</p>

<p>"Get off, you, who'd rob a poor old woman."</p>

<p>"We'll renounce the apartment, then," he
cried, with a laugh. "One room, citoyenne;
give me one room if you are a patriot."</p>

<p>"Patriot&mdash;robber! Be off or I'll denounce
you!"</p>

<p>The young fellow, seeing his case hopeless,
prepared to depart.</p>

<p>"Good-by, then, mother," he said. "And
thanks for your patriotic reception. Only direct
me to the house of Marat and I'm done with
you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<p>"What have you to do with the Citoyen
Marat?" cried the old woman, startled into
speech at that name.</p>

<p>"That is my affair."</p>

<p>"You know him?"</p>

<p>"I have a letter to him."</p>

<p>La Mère Corniche looked at him in indecision.
An emissary to Marat was a very different
matter. She struggled silently between her
avarice and the one adoration of her life, until
her listener, mistaking her silence, turned impatiently
on his heel.</p>

<p>"Here, come back," the concierge cried, thus
brought to decision. "Let me see your letter."</p>

<p>The young fellow shrugged his shoulders
good-humoredly and produced a large envelope,
on which the curious eye of his listener beheld
the magic words, "To Jean Paul Marat."
But if she had hoped to find on it some clue
to its sender, she was disappointed. She
turned the letter over and handed it reluctantly
back.</p>

<p>"Private business, hey?"</p>

<p>"Particularly private," he said. Then, seeing
his advantage and following up his good fortune,
he added: "Now, citoyenne, don't you
think you could tuck me away somewhere until
I make a fortune?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<p>The old woman hesitated a moment longer,
whereupon he fell to scanning pensively the address,
and mumbling over "Jean Paul Marat, a
great man that."</p>

<p>"Damn, I'll do it!" la Mère Corniche suddenly
cried, and with a crook of her thumb she
bade him follow her. But immediately she
halted and asked:</p>

<p>"Citoyen&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Citoyen Barabant&mdash;Eugène Armand Barabant."</p>

<p>"Of&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Of 38 Rue Maugout," he said laconically,
then, with a smile, modified his step to follow
the painful progress of his guide.</p>

<p>At the dark entrance a raven came hopping
to meet them, filling the gloom with his raucous
cry. Barabant halted.</p>

<p>"It's only Jean Paul," explained the old
woman. "He brings good luck."</p>

<p>She placed him, flapping his wings, on her
shoulder and continued. At the first court, by
the stairs that led to the vacant apartment on
the second floor, she hesitated, but the indecision
was momentary. Into the second court Barabant
followed with an air of interest that showed
that, though perhaps familiar with the streets of
Paris, he had never delved into its secret places.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Twice more la Mère Corniche halted before
possible lodgings, until at last, having vanquished
each temptation, she began to clamber up the
shaky flights that led to the attic.</p>

<p>Barabant had perceived each mental struggle
with great enjoyment. He was young, adventurous,
entering life through strange gates. So
when at length they reached the end of their
climb, and his guide, after much tugging, accompanied
by occasional kicks, had forced open
the reluctant door, the dingy attic appeared to
him a haven of splendor.</p>

<p>La Mère Corniche watched him curiously
from the doorway, rubbing her chin. "Eh,
Citoyen Barabant? Well, does it suit you?"</p>

<p>"Perfect."</p>

<p>He cast a careless glance at the impoverished
room and craned out of the window. In his
survey of the court, his eye rested a moment on
the window below, where, through the careless
folds of a half-curtain, he had caught the gleam
of a white arm.</p>

<p>"And what is the price of this?" he asked;
but his thoughts were elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>La Mère Corniche sighed heroically, and hastened
on as though distrusting her generosity.
"Only, when you see Citoyen Marat, tell him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>that I, Citoyenne Corniche, have done this to one
who is his friend."</p>

<p>Barabant remained one moment motionless,
as though confounded at this remnant of human
feeling in the sibyl. But the door had hardly
closed when, without a glance at his new quarters,
he was again at the window. The truth
was that, without hesitating to reflect on the insufficiency
of the evidence, he had already built
a romance on the sight of a white arm seen two
stories below through the folds of a curtain. So
when he returned eagerly to his scrutiny, what
was his disenchantment to perceive below a very
buxom matron, who was regarding him with
equal attentiveness.</p>

<p>Barabant, with a laugh at his own discomfiture,
began to search more cautiously. And as
one deception in youth is sufficient to make a
skeptic for an hour, when in turn he began to
explore the window opposite he received, with
indifference, the view of another arm, though it
was equally white and well modeled.</p>

<p>But this time, as though Fate were determined
to rebuke him for scorning her gifts, there appeared
at the window the figure of a young girl,
whose early toilet allowed to be seen a throat
and arm of sufficient whiteness to dazzle the
young romanticist.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>Youth and natural coquetry fortunately are
stronger than the indifference of poverty. Had
Barabant been fifty the girl would have continued
her inspection undisturbed; but perceiving him
to be in the twenties, and with a certain air of
distinction, she hastily withdrew, covering her
throat with an instinctive motion of her hand,
and leaving Barabant, forgetful of his first disenchantment,
to gallop through the delightful fields

<h2>II<br />
<small>A RESCUE FROM ARISTOCRATS</small></h2>


<p>After a moment of vain expectation, Barabant
withdrew to the inspection of his
new possessions. In one corner stood a bed that
bore the marks of many restorations. Each leg
was of a different shape, rudely fastened to the
main body, which, despite threatening fissures,
had still survived by the aid of several hitches
of stout rope that encouraged the joints. One
pillow and two coverings, one chair and a chest
of drawers, that answered to much tugging, completed
the installation. The floor was of tiles;
the ceiling, responding to the sagging of the roof,
bulged and cracked, while in one spot it had
even receded so far that a ray of the sun squeezed
through and fell in a dusty flight to the floor.</p>

<p>Barabant's survey was completed in an instant.
Returning to the bed, he paused doubtfully and
cautiously tried its strength with a shake. Then
he seated himself and slowly drew up both legs.
The bed still remaining intact, he turned over,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>threw the covers over him, and, worn out with the
journey, fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was almost ten when he stirred, and the
August sun was pouring through the gabled
window. A mouse scampered hurriedly home
as he started up; a couple of sparrows, hovering
undecidedly on the sill, fluttered off. He sat up,
rubbing his eyes with the confusion of one who
awakens at an unaccustomed hour, and then
sprang to the floor so impetuously that the bed
protested with a warning creak. His first movement
was to the window, where an eager glance
showed the opposite room vacant. More leisurely
he turned to a survey of his horizon, where in
the distance the roofs, of an equal height, rolled
away in high, sloping billows of brown tile dotted
with flashes of green or the white fleck of linen.
The air was warm, but still alive with the freshness
of the morning, inviting him to be out and seeing.
He left his bundle carelessly on the chair,
brushed his clothes, arranged his neck-cloth by
means of a pocket-mirror, preparing himself with
solicitude for his appearance in the streets.</p>

<p>He descended the stairs alertly, listening for
any sound of his neighbors; but the stairways, as
well as the courts, were silent and empty, for at
that period all Paris hastened daily to the streets,
expectant of great events.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>Through the ugly, tortuous streets of the Faubourg
St. Antoine Barabant plunged eagerly to
the boulevard, where the crowd, circulating
slowly, lingered from corner to corner, drifting to
every knot of discussion, avaricious for every
crumb of rumor. Hawkers of ballads and pamphlets
sought to slip their wares into the young
fellow's hand with a show of mystery and fear of
detection. One whispered his "Midnight Diversions
of the Austrian Veto"; another showed him
furtively the title, "Capet Exposed by his Valet."</p>

<p>Refusing all these, Barabant halted at every
shop-window, before numberless engravings representing
the Fall of the Bastille, the Oath in the
Tennis-court, and the Section-halls.</p>

<p>The gloomy, disheveled figures of the Marseillais
were abroad, stalking melodramatically
through the crowds or filling the cafés to thunder
out their denunciations of tyrants and aristocrats.
Fishwives and washerwomen retailed to all
comers the latest alarms.</p>

<p>"The aristocrats are burning the grain-fields!"</p>

<p>"A plot has been unearthed to exterminate
the patriots by grinding glass in their flour."</p>

<p>"The Faubourg St. Antoine is to be destroyed
by fire."</p>

<p>Venders of relics offered the manacles of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Bastille and the rope-ladder of Latude; fortune-tellers
prophesied, for a consideration, the fall of
Capet and the advent of the Republic; an exhibitor
of trick-dogs advertised a burlesque on
the return of the royal family from Versailles.
At a marionette theater the dolls represented
public personages, and the king and the queen
(Veto and the Austrian) were battered and humiliated
to the applause of the crowds.</p>

<p>At points on Barabant's progress he listened
to young fellows from tables or chairs reading to
the illiterate from the newspapers, quoting from
witty Camille Desmoulins or sullen, headlong
Marat. Barabant was amazed at the response
from the audience, at their sudden movements
to laughter or anger. Swayed by the infection,
his lips moved involuntarily with a hundred impetuous
thoughts. In this era that promised so
much to youth, which demanded its ardor, its
enthusiasm, and its faith, he longed to emerge
from obscurity. For youth is the period of
large resolutions, ardent convictions, and the
championship of desperate causes. In that season,
when the world is new, the mind, fascinated by
its unfolding strength, leaps over decisions, doubts
nothing, nor hesitates. In revolutions it is the
generation that dares that leads.</p>

<p>From the young and daring Faubourg St.
Antoine Barabant emerged, inspired, elated, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>meditative. Barabant, disciple of the Revolution
of Ideas, was bewildered by the might of this
torrent. It excited his vision, but it terrified
him. It was immense, but it might erupt
through a dozen forced openings.</p>

<p>In the Rue St. Honoré, where the discussions
grew more abstract, he was startled at the contrast.
Great events were struggling to the surface,
yet here in the cafés men discussed charmingly
on theory and principle; nor could he
fancy, fresh from the vigor of the people, the
sacred Revolution among these gay colors, immaculate
wigs, and well-fed and thirsty orators.</p>

<p>But this first impression, acute with the shock
of contrast, was soon succeeded by a feeling of
stimulation. Attracted, as is natural in youth,
by the beautiful and the luxurious, and led by
his imagination and his ambition, he forgot his
emotions. Whereas in the mob he had felt
himself equal to the martyr, he now breathed an
air that aroused his powers. They discussed the
freedom of the individual, the liberty of the press,
and the abolishment of the penalty of death, with
grace and with unfailing, agile wit, and debated
the Republic with the airs of the court.</p>

<p>Barabant, who wished to see everything at
once, made a rapid excursion to the Tuileries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>to the Place de la Grève, the Place de la Revolution,
the Markets, and the famous Hall of the
Jacobins.</p>

<p>Toward evening, as the dusk invaded the
streets, and the lanterns, from their brackets on
the walls, set up their empire over the fleeting
day, an indefinable melancholy descended over
him: the melancholy of the city that affects the
young and the stranger. Barabant's spirits, quick
to soar, momentarily succumbed to that feeling
of loneliness and aloofness that attacks the individual
in the solitudes of nature and in that
wilderness of men, the city.</p>

<p>He was leaning against a pillar in the Rue St.
Honoré, in this ruminative mood watching the
unfamiliar crowd, when his glance was stopped
by the figure of a flower-girl. She was tall, dark,
and lithe, and, though without any particular
charm of form, she had such an unusual grace
in her movements that he fell curiously to speculating
on her face. But the turning proving a
disappointment, he laughed at his haste, and his
glance wandered elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Citoyen, buy my cockade?"</p>

<p>Barabant turned quickly; the flower-girl was
at his side, smiling mischievously up at him.
He was conscious of a sudden embarrassment&mdash;a
solicitude for his bearing before the frank
amusement of the girl. This time he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>turn away so carelessly. The face was attractive
despite its irregularity, full of force in the free
span of the forehead and of sudden passions in the
high, starting eyebrows. The eyes alone seemed
cold and sardonic, without emotion or change.</p>

<p>"Come, citoyen, a cockade."</p>

<p>Barabant shrugged his shoulders, and diving
into his purse, at length produced a few coppers.</p>

<p>"A patriot's dinner is more my need, citoyenne,
than a cockade."</p>

<p>The girl, who had been watching with amusement
this search after the elusive coins, ignoring
his answer, asked curiously:</p>

<p>"From the provinces?"</p>

<p>Barabant, resenting the patronizing tone, said
stiffly:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But not quite Parisian," the flower-girl returned,
with a smile, and her glance traveled inquiringly
over the incongruous make-up.</p>

<p>Barabant laughed. "Parisian by a day only."</p>

<p>The girl smiled again, and, suddenly fastening
a cockade on his lapel, said: "You are a good-looking
chap; keep your sous; when your purse
is fuller, remember me." And thrusting back
his proffered money, she took up her basket and
nodded gaily to him. "Good luck to you, citoyen.
Vive la jeunesse!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>The accidental meeting quite restored him to
his eager zest again. The one greeting converted
the wilderness into a familiar land. He
started on his walk, seeking a humble bill of
fare within the range of his modest resources.
He chose one where the dinner consisted of a
thick soup the filling qualities of which he knew&mdash;a
purée of beans and a piece of cheese. It was
still somewhat earlier than the dinner-hour, and
he finished his meal silently watched by the
waiter with suspicious eyes. Thence he wandered
through brighter streets, pausing at times
on the skirts of the crowd that invaded the
cafés, which now began to grow noisy with impromptu
oratory.</p>

<p>The Palais Royal with its flaring halls drew
him to its tumultuous life. He wandered through
the gambling-rooms, through fakers' exhibitions,
heedless of siren voices, watching the play of
pickpockets and dupes, until suddenly in the
crowd a figure of unusual oddity caught his
attention: a tall, military man with a cocked
hat, shifted very much over one ear, and a nose
thrown back so far that it seemed to be scouting
in the air, fearful lest its owner should miss a
single rumor.</p>

<p>Without purpose in his wanderings, Barabant
unconsciously fell to following this new character.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>The body was lank, the legs long,&mdash;out of all proportion,
and so thin that they seemed rather a
pair of pliable stilts,&mdash;while the arms hung or
moved in loose jerks as though dependent from
the joints of a manikin.</p>

<p>Oblivious to the banter and the scrutiny of the
throng, the wanderer pursued his inquisitive way.
From time to time he stopped, craning his neck
and remaining absorbed in the contemplation of
a chance display of tricolor or a group of shrill
orators sounding their eloquence to the eager
mass. The inspection ended, a guttural exclamation
or a whistle escaping the lips showed that the
impression had been registered behind the keen,
laughing countenance. Gradually the crowd,
inclined at first to jeer, perceiving him utterly
unconscious of their interest, turned to banter;
but there too they were met with the utmost
complacency.</p>

<p>"Hey, Daddy Long-legs!"</p>

<p>"Beware you keep out of their reach, my
friend."</p>

<p>"Citizen Scissors!"</p>

<p>"Citizen Stilts!"</p>

<p>"Citizen Pique la bise!"</p>

<p>At this last allusion to the manner in which his
nose might be said to cut the breeze, he opened
wide a gaping mouth and roared "Touché!" so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>heartily that the crowd, who never laugh long
at those who laugh with them, returned to their
occupation with grunts of approval. Still there
remained to be revealed the complexion of his
political belief: whether it was a patriot that
thus paraded the steadfast Palais Royal, or a hireling
of a tyrant aristocracy.</p>

<p>Here again the visitor puzzled all conjectures.
Arrived opposite the café, "To the Fall of the
Bastille," his glance no sooner seized the inscription
than he snatched off his hat with so hearty
a "Bravo!" that his neighbors echoed the infectious
acclamation; but at the very next turn,
perceiving a mountebank's counter presided over
by a pretty citizeness, he paused and repeated
the salute with equal vigor. Now, though the
tribute to a pretty face could not justly distinguish
the parties, yet the inspiration and the manner
had the taint of aristocracy. So that those who
had listened looked dubious, then scratched their
heads, and finally retired, laughing over their own
mystification.</p>

<p>With a gluttonous chuckle the stranger
turned suddenly into a neighboring passage.
Barabant followed, in time to see the lean figure
mount a chance staircase, ascending which on
the humor of the moment, he emerged in turn
into a café of unusual magnificence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p>Having no money with which to pay a <i>consommation</i>
at the tables, Barabant remained
among the spectators. The tall stranger had
joined a group in the middle of the room, whence
a florid Chevalier de St. Louis cried bombastically:</p>

<p>"Citizen Bottle-opener, send me the Citizen
Table-wiper!"</p>

<p>"And bring the Citizen Broom," took up another,
"to expel this Citizen Dog!"</p>

<p>"Let the Citizen Crier," added another, with
careless scorn, "call the Citizen My Carriage!"</p>

<p>Amid this persiflage Barabant remained, chafing
and angry, realizing that he had stumbled
into that abomination of patriots, a den of
aristocrats.</p>

<p>The purport of all table-to-table addresses was
the incompetency of the National Assembly and
the state of anarchy existing since the royal power
had been defied. Although the café was not accessible
to the mob, and was evidently of a certain
clientèle, there was a smattering of unaccustomed
guests, who manifested their disapproval of these
remarks by grumbling and even threats.</p>

<p>Barabant at length, losing control of his temper,
sprang upon a chair.</p>

<p>"A government," he cried&mdash;"yes, a government
is what we need. Let us be frank: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>present condition of affairs is an anomaly. It
cannot exist. The Revolution is to-day a farce."</p>

<p>"Anarchy!" "Chaos!" "Bravo!" "Continue!"</p>

<p>"And why?" he went on. "Because it has
not gone far enough. Either king or revolution:
the two cannot exist. What we need is the
Republic, the Republic, the Republic!"</p>

<p>The words fell on the room like offal thrown
in the midst of ravenous wolves. A hideous
upheaval, a hoarse shout, a multitude of scrambling
forms, and the listeners who had mistaken
the drift of his first words rose in fury. Some
one pulled the table from under him. There
were shouts and blows, a confusion of bodies
before his eyes, and babel let loose. In the
midst of it he felt himself suddenly enveloped
in a pair of wiry arms and dragged through the
mêlée. He struggled, but the grip that held him
was not to be shaken. Leaving behind the
shouting, they passed out into the turning of a
corridor, then through another into quiet and a
garden. There his captor, setting him on his
feet, drew back with a smile. Barabant, glancing
up, beheld the lank military figure of an
hour before, with his nose tipped in the air in impudent
enjoyment.</p>

<p>"Well, my knight-errant," he said quizzically,
"the next time you preach the Republic, select
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>a Sans-Culotte audience and not a Royalist café,
or there may not be a Dossonville to rescue
you."</p>

<p>Barabant smoothed out his clothes, crestfallen,
but resumed his dignity.</p>

<p>"From the country!" his rescuer continued,
and the amusement gave place to one of reflectiveness.
"Dame! are they already crying
for the Republic outside of Paris?"</p>

<p>"They are. That is," Barabant added, "the
masses are done with the king. The Girondins
are not so radical."</p>

<p>"H'm!" Dossonville said for all answer. He
stood silent a moment, wrapped in his own
thoughts, before he again questioned him: "And
the Revolution: do you hear such opinions as
you heard to-night in the provinces? Is there
no sign of a reaction?"</p>

<p>"No; everything is for more radical measures."</p>

<p>With this answer, Dossonville seemed to dismiss
the matter from his mind. He looked him
over again, and a twinkle showing in his eyes, he
asked:</p>

<p>"More enthusiasm than friends, hey?"</p>

<p>Barabant laughed. "True."</p>

<p>"And what are you counting upon doing?"</p>

<p>Barabant remained silent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p>"Good&mdash;discretion!"</p>

<p>Barabant, determined to shift the inquiry, demanded
point-blank:</p>

<p>"What were you doing in a café of aristocrats?"</p>

<p>"What were you?" Dossonville retorted.
"There are many ways to serve the Revolution
besides proclaiming it from the tops of tables.
Leave me my ways. Do you think if I were an
aristocrat I'd have taken the pains to save you?
Come, young man, don't turn your back on
opportunities. Swallow your pride and confess
that there are not many more meals in sight."</p>

<p>"I am but a day in Paris," Barabant answered;
and then, lest he should seem to have relented:
"there are a hundred ways to find a living."</p>

<p>"Can you write? Have you written pamphlets?"
Dossonville persisted. "What would
you say to a chance to see that fine eloquence
caught in black and white and circulating in the
streets?"</p>

<p>Barabant's face flushed with such a sudden
delight that the other laughingly drew his arm
into his and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Come, I see how it is. Camille Desmoulins
is only twenty-nine. It is the age for the youngsters.
Only&mdash;" He stopped suddenly. "There
are many degrees of Republicans nowadays.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Does your eloquence run in the line of our
valiant radical Marat, or Danton and Desmoulins,
or are we of the school of Condorcet and
Roland?"</p>

<p>"I am Girondin," Barabant answered.</p>

<p>"Good." He reflected a moment. "Just the
place!"</p>

<p>He started on, and then suddenly stopped, as
by habit of caution. "No, not to-night. Where
do you live?"</p>

<p>"Eugène Barabant, Rue Maugout, No. 38."
He drew out two letters. "I have a word of
introduction to Roland."</p>

<p>"And the other?"</p>

<p>"To Marat."</p>

<p>"Ah, Marat," Dossonville said, with a sudden
cooling. "A strong man that, and very patriotic."</p>

<p>"I do not intend to present it," Barabant said,
seeing the change. He hesitated a moment, as
though to reveal a confidence, while a smile
struggled to his lips. But in the end, resisting
the desire, he said evasively, "It is a measure of
protection, in case of danger."</p>

<p>Dossonville scrutinized him sharply, and then,
as though reassured by the frank visage, he said:
"Very well; I'll be around to-morrow night.
Try your hand at a polemic or two. Have you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>a knack of poetry? Satires are more powerful
than arguments. A laugh can trip up a colossus."</p>

<p>"I have done a little verse."</p>

<p>"Who hasn't?" He paused. "You will be
discreet? Au revoir!"</p>

<p>He turned on his heel, but immediately returned.</p>

<p>"I forgot. One word of advice."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Revolutions strike only among the steeples.
Take my advice: renounce publicity and remain
obscure."</p>

<p>"But I had rather die in this age than live
through another."</p>

<p>"Well, my duty's done," Dossonville answered,
shrugging his shoulders. Then repeating to
himself Barabant's last response, he added, "That
sounds well; food for the mob; put it down."</p>

<p>And without more ado, he left him as delighted
as though he had just been elected to
the National Convention.</p>

<h2>III<br />
<small>CITOYENNE NICOLE</small>
</h2>




<p>Toward six o'clock the next morning,
when la Mère Corniche and her broom
alone were stirring, there appeared at a gabled
window that broke through the crust of the
roofs, the figure of a young girl, who, after a
glance down at the quiet courtyard and the
windows void of life, remained to give the final
touches to a scattering of golden hair.</p>

<p>The air was still young, and in the skies the
multifarious tints of the dawn had not quite
faded as the burly sun bobbed up among the
distant chimney-tops. She ensconced herself in
the window, running her hands with indolent
movements through the meshes as though reluctant
to leave the flash and play of the sun
amid its lusters. She was young and pretty, and
she knew it, and, with a frank enjoyment, she let
the long locks slip through her fingers or brought
them caressingly against her cheek.</p>

<p>Though from her figure she could not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>been more than eighteen, yet in the poise of her
head and in the subtile smile, full of grace and
piquancy, there showed the coquetry of the
woman who plans to please the masculine eye.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sprang back, leaving the window
vacant. A moment later there emerged
opposite the thoughtful face of Barabant. Unaware
of her proximity, he swept the courtyard
with an indifferent look, and drawing from his
pocket the three sous that alone remained to
him, he fell into a deep meditation.</p>

<p>Presently the sprightly eyes and mischievous
profile of the girl returned, cautiously, as though
awaiting a challenge. Then, as in the abstraction
of his mood he continued to be oblivious to
her presence, she advanced to fuller view.</p>

<p>Gradually her curiosity became excited by an
evident conflict in his moods. At one moment
he pulled a long, somber face, and at the next
he lapsed into laughter. As human nature cannot
endure in silence the spectacle of someone
laughing to himself, the girl, unable longer to
restrain her interest, called to him with that melody
which is natural to the voice of a maiden:</p>

<p>"Well, citoyen, are you going to laugh or
cry?"</p>

<p>At her banter, Barabant started up so suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>that one of the sous which he had been regarding
meditatively slipped from his fingers,
bounded on the roof, rolled along the gutter,
and disappeared in the water-hole.</p>

<p>"Diable! there goes my dinner!"</p>

<p>"How so?" the girl said, repressing her
laugh at his long face.</p>

<p>"I had three; one for lunch, one for dinner,
and one for some purchases I intend to make."</p>

<p>"Dame! citoyen, three are not many sous."</p>

<p>Barabant drew himself up proudly. "Plenty,
after to-night."</p>

<p>"When your banker returns?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"And I have made you lose your dinner: a
bad beginning for neighbors, Citoyen&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Citoyen Eugène Barabant. Citoyenne&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Nicole."</p>

<p>"Nicole&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Heavens, isn't Nicole enough? One name
is all we need; besides, it would take me too
long to find out the other."</p>

<p>As she said this, she smiled so unaffectedly
that Barabant, forgetting the pangs of hunger,
looked on admiringly.</p>

<p>"You are a philosopher, Nicole. And what
do you do&mdash;if it is not indiscreet to ask?"</p>

<p>She understood perfectly the hesitancy, but
laughed without a trace of disconcertion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, I work hard; I am a bouquetière.
Which reminds me, I must be off to the flower-market."</p>

<p>However, she lingered a moment. "And
you, citoyen?"</p>

<p>"Traveler," Barabant said, with a superb
wave of his hand, and then exploded in laughter
at the thought. "Citoyenne, tell me something."</p>

<p>"Speak."</p>

<p>"Have you ever fasted a day?"</p>

<p>"Hundreds of times."</p>

<p>"If you have but one meal in sight, when is
the best time to take it?"</p>

<p>"In the middle of the day; something may
happen before dinner."</p>

<p>Barabant made a wry face.</p>

<p>"Seriously, how much have you?"</p>

<p>He held up the two sous.</p>

<p>"Two sous, and you speak of buying a meal,&mdash;a
crumb of bread!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Barabant admitted, "meal is an
exaggeration."</p>

<p>"Come, you are a good fellow," Nicole said,
nodding approvingly. "You have the right
spirit. I have made you lose one dinner; it is
only right that I should make reparation. Will
you lunch with me?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>To her amusement, he drew up proudly at the
thought of accepting a favor from her. She
smiled at this show of pride, liking it, but
trusting in the bloom and charm of her youth to
defeat it. She did not trust in vain. After a
brief conflict which showed clearly the weak
surrender, he ended by smiling in turn.</p>

<p>"Only," he cried, "I accept it as a loan."</p>

<p>"Heavens! but I didn't intend to pay, myself,"
she protested, well pleased with her victory. "If
you think dinners are to be had only for pay
you are not a Parisian yet."</p>

<p>"In that case, I accept."</p>

<p>"Meet me, then, at eleven o'clock, Place de la
République, Citoyen Barabant."</p>

<p>"I shall be there an hour ahead!"</p>

<p>At the door of the next room she called,
"Louison!" drumming quietly with her fingers.
Receiving no answer, she entered. The bed was
vacant, undisturbed. Without surprise, and with
even a certain satisfaction at being freed from
the company of her friend, she passed down and
out into the streets on her way to the Marché des
Fleurs.</p>

<p>As she went, with many an energetic toss of
her head interspersed with pensive smiles, she
turned over in her mind the impressions of her
first encounter, with the confidence of the woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>who at the first exchange of glances feels her
power. He had shown his admiration without
timidity, which would have been vexatious, or
forwardness, which would have been unendurable.
She liked his show of pride, and more
that he had yielded before the temptation of her
eyes. That tribute sent her straying into the
thousand and one pleasurable paths with which
her ardent imagination filled the future.</p>

<p>At the flower-markets her preoccupation was
so evident that she was compelled to run the fire
of banter. She bore the ordeal with equanimity,
hurrying away with buoyant step and eyes alert,
impatient for the morning to pass.</p>

<p>She passed along the boulevards, disposing of
her cockades among regular customers, until at
length she arrived at her destination, the Café
Procopé. There, mounted on a chair, a short,
roly-poly ragamuffin, with bloated, pouter cheeks
and squinting, almond eyes, was reading the
morning bulletins in such thunderous tones that
one readily divined the crier of carriages, whose
voice had been trained in the battle of street
sounds.</p>

<p>Among those assembled at the tables, she directed
her way to where a gruff, gaunt man,
sunk in a capacious redingote, was heralding
her approach with a look of welcome.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>"Good morning, Papa Goursac," she said,
slipping into a waiting seat. "Here's your
cockade,&mdash;the best, as usual!"</p>

<p>"There, take your drink," he answered,
showing her the glass. He roused himself from
his attitude of whimsical inspection, turning to
her a look that belied the stern voice. "Well,
and what luck to-day?"</p>

<p>"The best," she said, showing him her lightly
laden basket.</p>

<p>"Of course you did not notice the new
lodger," said Goursac, scornfully. His bushy
eyebrows and looming beak seemed so grim that
Nicole with difficulty suppressed a laugh.</p>

<p>"Indeed," she said, pretending ignorance to
plague him, "is there a new lodger?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he's a doctor, old as I am, so he'll
not interest you."</p>

<p>"What a bad humor you are in," she said,
enjoying his wrath. "As though you did not
interest me!"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean."</p>

<p>Aware of his suspicious scrutiny, she continued.
"What a pity! Why couldn't he
have been a young fellow? Ah, mon Dieu,
what time is it?"</p>

<p>"Why do you want to know?" growled
Goursac. "Whom are you going to meet?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>"The old doctor, of course," she answered,
laughing as she escaped.</p>

<p>As she passed in front, the ragamuffin was
still roaring the news.</p>

<p>"Heavens, Jambony," she cried, "there is no
need to let the foreigners know what is taking
place!"</p>

<p>"Citoyenne, you exaggerate," the carriage-crier
answered; "I am only whispering."</p>

<p>"Then, my dear Jambony, just think your
thoughts. I am sure they will be loud enough!"</p>

<p>In great good humor, she began to work her
way in the direction of the wrecked Bastille, and
perhaps from the very elevation of her spirits,
good luck quickly emptied her basket. Thus
freed, she lapsed into the spectator, flattening her
nose against the shop-windows or drifting lazily
from knot to knot of discussion.</p>

<p>All at once, when she was wandering from the
thoroughfares among a tangle of silent, murky
alleys, a child's scream brought her to an attentive
halt. The cries redoubled. Without a
thought of personal danger, she plunged recklessly
down the alley in the direction of the appeals.
Under the bulging shadow of a balcony a girl
was struggling in the clutches of a mountebank,
while, from a box on the ground, a monkey was
adding its shrill chatter to the broil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>At Nicole's charge the man released the girl
with an oath and sprang back against the wall.
At the sight of the shriveled-parchment face
and the familiar leer Nicole burst out, in astonishment:</p>

<p>"Ah, Cramoisin, I might have known it was
you!" She replaced in her belt the knife she had
drawn, facing him with the whips of her scorn.</p>

<p>"Women are too strong for you, then! You
must match your strength with children. Bravo!
my brave fellow, you are the victor at last. Wait
until I sing your praises. You shall become
famous, tamer of children!"</p>

<p>"Vixen!" shrieked the mountebank, stung to
words by her gadding. He shook a lean fist at
her, crying, "Thy turn'll come!"</p>

<p>"And I who thought you were pining away
for love of me!" she continued mercilessly.
"Fickle Cramoisin! There, be off, be off, do you
hear, or I shall be tempted to chastise you!"</p>

<p>Cramoisin, not disdaining the offer of retreat,
slung his mountebank's box on his back and
scurried off, the ape on his shoulder chattering
back at them with communicated fear.</p>

<p>Nicole turned. A slip of a girl, half child,
half savage, was regarding her from round, wolfish
eyes, shrinking against the wall. "There,
there, ma petite," she said, "there is nothing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>cry about. That Cramoisin is as weak as a leaf;
you could have pushed him over with a finger.
And your knife?"</p>

<p>The girl, still sobbing, shook her head.</p>

<p>"Heavens! child, you are not fit to be abroad.
There, stop crying, I tell you. I do not like to
hear it." But perceiving that the girl was
thoroughly unnerved, she abandoned her note of
command, and, enveloping her with her arm, said
gently: "Come, mon enfant, I promise you there
is nothing more to fear. Cramoisin is as much
afraid of me as the fat Louis of the Citoyen
Marat. I'll take you under my protection. You
are nothing but a child; no wonder the brute has
frightened you. Come, what's your name?"</p>

<p>"Geneviève."</p>

<p>"How old?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen."</p>

<p>"But that is almost a woman! Why, I am
but eighteen. One must be gay, that is all, and
have a bit of a temper."</p>

<p>Seeing that the girl was recovering, she continued
for a while her light tone. "And where
do you live?"</p>

<p>"38 Rue Maugout."</p>

<p>"Impossible! Since when?"</p>

<p>"Two months."</p>

<p>"How curious! And I have never noticed you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am not very big."</p>

<p>"Bah, you are big enough and old enough,
only you need some hints. See there!" With a
deft hand she drew in the dress over the hips
and loosened it at the throat. "You have really
a good figure, but you don't know it. You must
be coquette before you can be a woman. In
future I'll keep an eye on you. Where do you
sleep?"</p>

<p>"In the cellar."</p>

<p>"I thought so. Sleep with me to-night, then;
there's room enough. All right now? I must be
going."</p>

<p>Geneviève caught her hand and covered it
with kisses.</p>

<p>"There, kiss my cheek," Nicole said, affected
by her display of gratitude. "What a baby!
You shall stay with me. Until to-night, then."</p>

<p>All at once she remembered her engagement,
and on the moment, forgetting the new partnership
so lightly contracted, she hurried away, with
such good will that she arrived exactly on time.
As this was not to her liking, she screened herself
in the crowd, seeking Barabant. She found
him soon, approaching, still immersed in his projected
article and betraying his preoccupation
by such scowls and sudden gestures that the
passers-by would have taken him for demented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>had not the spectacle been one familiar to their
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, mon Dieu!" Nicole said to herself, "I
thought I'd found a man, and he turns out a
philosopher. Also, he does not seem very much
occupied in looking for me!"</p>

<p>She stepped forward to meet him, saying mischievously:
"Well, have you settled the affairs
of the nation? What furor on an empty stomach,
Citoyen Eugène!"</p>

<p>Barabant returned to earth quickly, not a little
ashamed at the flights of his imagination, and
his laugh betrayed his discomfiture as he said:</p>

<p>"It helps one to forget the vacancy."</p>

<p>Nicole leading the way, they hurried through
the thronged streets, scenting at every step the
inviting odor of soups and stews, until they
arrived at a large tavern, or brasserie, around
which was a thick crowd struggling for admission.</p>

<p>"Have you heard of Santerre?" Nicole said.
"A very wise man who has discovered that the
seat of popularity lies in the stomach."</p>

<p>"The Romans placed all the affections there."</p>

<p>"Ah, you've had an education," Nicole said,
with a new respect. "There's Santerre."</p>

<p>Before the entrance a huge mass of a man,
boisterous in his hospitality and his laughter,
was distributing enormous hand-shakes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>
<p>Nicole saluted him with evident familiarity.</p>

<p>"I have brought you a patriot to dinner,
citoyen!"</p>

<p>Santerre winced a bit and grumbled:</p>

<p>"Eh, Nicole, and you have brought yourself
along."</p>

<p>"Vive Santerre!" the girl cried, with a laugh.
"Citoyen Barabant has just arrived, and the first
thing he asked was to see the famous leader of
the Faubourg St. Antoine."</p>

<p>"At lunch-time, of course," said Santerre, with
a shrug. "Pass in and eat."</p>

<p>Nicole seized Barabant by the hand and entered
the restaurant, already crowded with the
self-invited guests of the leader's ready hospitality.
They found a corner table and settled
down to a quiet inspection of the noisy room.</p>

<p>Masons, carters, and laborers preponderated,
while a smattering of young lawyers and journalists
circulated from table to table, with ready
hand-shakes, to take up the conversation or clink
a glass in toasts to the dozen subjects most in
favor. Above the din of plates and cutlery,
cutting the hum of voices, the toasts emerged
sharply.</p>

<p>"To the Bonnets Rouges!"</p>

<p>"To the good Sans-Culottes!"</p>

<p>"À bas les Tyrans!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>"Vive la Constitution!"</p>

<p>"Vive Santerre!"</p>

<p>"Long life to our host!"</p>

<p>At times the Carmagnole, at times some popular
ballad of the day, would start from a corner,
and gathering headway, would gradually run
through the noise of the room until, absorbing
all other sounds, it ended in a gale. Whereupon
there would be a clatter of knives and
glass, shouts of "Bravo!" laughter, and more
drinking.</p>

<p>Barabant was too susceptible a nature not to
respond to the magnetism of such surroundings.
His look regained all its ardor of the morning,
until Nicole regarded him with a new interest.
He had the long, narrow forehead of the period,
marked with thoughtfulness and curiosity. The
nose was high-bridged, the nostrils were sensitive
and dilating with emotion. The gray eyes were
shrewd, kind, gay, and noting, with the mobility
and charm of the enthusiast, but, in their repose,
without that impress of authority and earnestness
of purpose which give to the man of imagination
the genius of leadership.</p>

<p>"Come, citoyen," Nicole said, at the end of
her inspection, "tell me something about yourself.
I am filled with curiosity."</p>

<p>"Ma foi, Nicole," Barabant answered, "it's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>not much. I was at Fontainebleau; I'm now in
Paris. I had an uncle who disapproved of my
ideas; he showed me the door, I declared his
goods confiscate, and here I am, not a bit depressed,&mdash;with
but one debt," he added as an
afterthought.</p>

<p>"Debts are aristocratic; renounce them."</p>

<p>"The trouble is, I can't rid myself of the
creditor, though I pay him over and over."</p>

<p>Nicole raised her glance in surprise, but Barabant
added, smiling, "It is my stomach, and a
persistent creditor he is."</p>

<p>Nicole laughed gaily. "There, touch hands,"
she cried. "You are the philosopher." Persisting
in her inquiry, she continued encouragingly:
"You have a father?"</p>

<p>Barabant smiled. "And a mother, too. And
now no more questions, Nicole, for I shall refuse
them."</p>

<p>She drew back with a little movement of
pique, but yielding to her natural moods, she
lifted her eyebrows and, with her charming
smile, said with frankness:</p>

<p>"Ah, you are legitimate, then. I have only
a mother; that is to say, I had. She is dead
now. I don't remember her. God rest her soul."</p>

<p>A little movement of superstition passed over
her face and she crossed herself. "My father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>was a sergeant of the line, so they tell me." She
threw out the palms of her hands. "Who
knows? It might as well be a rag-picker, or a
prince, for all the good it does me."</p>

<p>"Diable!" Barabant exclaimed, regarding her
more closely. "You don't seem to be cast
down."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; it's only this year I've been by
myself. I was brought up by my aunt&mdash;Aunt
Berthe. What a woman!" She shook her head
grimly. "When I came in late she beat me,&mdash;oh,
but solidly, firmly." She grimaced and,
with the instinct of acting that is of the people,
drew her hand across her shoulder, as though
still smarting under the sting. "And do you
know how it ended?"</p>

<p>"Well, how?"</p>

<p>"It ended by my taking the cane from her
one night and laying it over her. Oh, such a
beating! I was striking for old scores. Aïe!
aïe! After that, you understand, I couldn't
return."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"So I took a room next to Louison."</p>

<p>Barabant raised his eyebrows in question.</p>

<p>"Louison? She's a comrade. You will
see her." She stopped. "We are good friends,
only I&mdash;well&mdash;I don't know." Nicole, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>conversed abundantly with her shoulders, raised
them again. "When you're rich you can choose;
but with us, we take what's nearest. We must
have some one to gossip with, to weep with, to
laugh with, to confide a little in, and so we
take what we can get. That's how it is." Suddenly
she halted suspiciously. "Are you a
patriot?" she asked point-blank.</p>

<p>"You'd have thought so last night." Barabant,
remembering the drubbing he had escaped
the night before, grinned and nodded. At his
description of the café Nicole showed great
interest.</p>

<p>"You said that, and escaped with your life
from that den of aristocrats!" she exclaimed, in
horror, for she had the popular idea that aristocrats
were ogres and inhuman monsters. At the
first words descriptive of his rescue she cried:</p>

<p>"Dossonville; beyond a doubt, Dossonville!"</p>

<p>"What, do you know him?" said Barabant.
"Who and what is he?"</p>

<p>"Now you have asked me a question. What
is Dossonville?" Suddenly she became serious.
"He is a mystery to me and to more than me.
Frankly, I do not know his party, and don't believe
any one else does. He is here and there,
with the patriots one moment and the court the
next; but whether he is acting for one side or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>for neither, no one knows. And he rescued
you!" She meditated a moment. "That sounds
like a patriot; but then, what was he doing in
such a place?"</p>

<p>The crowd became more boisterous as the
wine-jugs grew lighter; seeing which, Nicole
rose and made a sign to him to follow. In the
front room she stopped before a vat on which,
his huge body astride, Santerre was bandying jests
with the crowd. Nicole, approaching, whispered:</p>

<p>"Is it for to-night?"</p>

<p>The brewer affected not to understand her.</p>

<p>"Look here, my big fellow," she said, with the
familiarity of the day, "do you want me to cry
it from the housetops? Will you understand
me now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know when it is to be, or if it will
ever be." He sank his voice. "The leaders are
wavering; only the tocsin can tell."</p>

<p>"We assemble by sections?"</p>

<p>Santerre nodded.</p>

<p>Nicole, only half satisfied, turned away.</p>

<p>Barabant, who had overheard enough to form
a conjecture, kept his counsel; but Nicole, approving
his discretion, imparted the information.</p>

<p>"They say we are to storm the Tuileries.
But every one hangs back. They are in a panic
at the last moment."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, it is folly; think of the National
Guard!" Barabant exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I see well you have just arrived. The National
Guard, indeed! We are the National
Guard. It is only the Swiss we have to fear."</p>

<p>They had gained the right bank of the Seine,
and paused from time to time to watch the
water-carriers filling their casks in the river, and
the loiterers angling sleepily in the shadow of
the boats.</p>

<p>Barabant, despite the fires of patriotic fervor,
had for some time forgotten his mission in the
contemplation of the fresh cheeks and the free
carriage of his companion, more and more beguiled
from his task of righting the wrongs of
the nation by this gipsy of the streets who traversed
the rough paths of fortune with such
perfect bonhomie.</p>

<p>Nicole, happening to look up, met an unmistakable
fixture of gaze, and divined the workings
of his mind. She withdrew slightly and said
reprovingly: "Not too fast, Citoyen Barabant;
we are not in the provinces."</p>

<p>Barabant defended himself.</p>

<p>"My dear Nicole, I have committed no
offense. I have done nothing but wish. Judge
my acts; my thoughts are not offenses."</p>

<p>"You are not slow at an answer, citoyen," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Nicole, amused. "There, take my hand if you
wish. Only, not too fast."</p>

<p>He took her hand, and together they went
joyfully through Paris, laughing like two children
of the people.</p>

<p>"Barabant, I like you," she said from time to
time. "You are a good fellow." Once she
added naïvely, "You know, all the same, it is
lonely at times." Then, with a laugh, "Allons,
comrade!"</p>

<p>She led him through the boulevards, pointing
out celebrities at every step, showing him the
cafés, Feuillantes or Jacobin. They were constantly
halted by the sudden assembly of a crowd
to listen to some singer perched on a chair above
their shoulders, intoning his ballads.</p>

<p>Presently Nicole said: "Barabant, do you not
feel something in the atmosphere&mdash;something
extraordinary?"</p>

<p>He sharpened his wits and gradually began to
distinguish currents in the crowd, and it seemed
to him that there was some subtle communication
by furtive glances of inquiry and nods of
intelligence.</p>

<p>"I believe it will be for to-night," she
whispered.</p>

<p>He felt in her hand something nervous and
exalted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>
<p>"Were you at the taking of the Bastille?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Wait till you see the women of Paris!"
Her eyes grew large as they lost themselves in
recollection. Then suddenly she added: "But
you haven't seen the gardens of the Palais Royal,
and the tree of the green cockades from which
Desmoulins called us to arms!"</p>

<p>Leading him into the historic garden, she
showed him the chestnut-tree surrounded by a
crowd of curious seekers, many of whom snatched
up the leaves for mementos.</p>

<p>Everywhere were swarms of children, shrieking
high, shrill notes, running and leaping, dodging
in and out of the most sedate groups, and
stopping occasionally to mimic the swollen front
and bombastic arm of the hundred and one
orators about whom swirled a hundred and one
eddies. Newsboys, racing ahead of their competitors,
cried hoarsely the latest bulletins; while
in their wake improvised orators mounted on
tables and announced the news amid a gale of
comments. Through the throng a score of flower-girls
twisted their way, calling their patriotic cockades,
nodding familiarly to Nicole, who from all
sides received salutations of deputies and orators.</p>

<p>"You are well known," said Barabant, surprised
at the range of her acquaintance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>"Pardi, I should hope so," she answered, with
a proud toss of her head. "Bouquetières are
useful. We go everywhere, see everything.
We are the scouts of the Republic. I have
influence, Barabant; I'll push you ahead," she
added, with a determined nod. "Can you speak
from the tribune?"</p>

<p>"I have done so."</p>

<p>"Good. You must go to the club. Speak
out. Do not be afraid. I adore fire and spirit!"
She looked at him critically. "You have the
eyes and the lips of the orator. Yes, I'm sure
you can speak."</p>

<p>Barabant thrilled at the inspiration in her eyes,
and some of the fierce, exulting spirit, the unconquerable
gaiety and daring of this gamine, passed
swiftly into his soul. Filled with the bombastic
daring and sublime confidence of the patriot,
he cried: "Give me the chance; give but the
chance! They shall hear me&mdash;and listen!"</p>

<p>Nicole had a wild impulse to embrace him,
but, restraining her enthusiasm, she contented
herself with passing from his hand to his arm.</p>

<p>"How old are you?" she asked all at once.</p>

<p>"I am twenty-four," Barabant said, with importance.</p>

<p>"Why, you are a child."</p>

<p>"Camille Desmoulins is not thirty."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>"True."</p>

<p>"And what is six years?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of it," admitted Nicole.
"I am eighteen; but in Paris at eighteen there
is not much unlearned. Allons, les enfants." She
drew up to his side, hanging a little on his arm.
"Barabant, you are a lucky fellow," she said mischievously.</p>

<p>Barabant, who perfectly understood her allusion
to mean lucky in meeting her, drew her
closer as they elbowed their way out of the
throng. He bent his head to scrutinize her, while
Nicole not too consciously accepted the gaze,
confident in herself: she was young and she
was a Parisian. Her features were rather saucy
than regular; her figure, though full and graceful,
was perhaps too perfect for eighteen, when a
certain slenderness is a future guaranty. But
the eyes of the young man do not look into the
future. Barabant saw only&mdash;giving color to her
cheeks, a glow to the eye, and a spring to the foot&mdash;that
bloom which is of youth and which speaks
of eagerness and impatience to embrace life.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nicole, seeking an interruption to
this scrutiny, which, though delightful, had become
embarrassing, exclaimed, "There's Louison
now." She made a movement as though to free
her arm, immediately checking it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>Barabant, looking up, beheld the high eyebrows,
the starting eyes, and the curious, thin
smile of the flower-girl who had spoken to him
the night before.</p>

<p>She sent Nicole a greeting from her fingertips,
and then perceiving Barabant, she accosted
him with a smile of tolerant amusement.</p>

<p>"Why, it's my little man from the country!"
Nodding, she passed, with the exclamation, "Bien
vrai, you don't lose any time!"</p>

<p>"What, you have already met her?" Nicole
exclaimed, disengaging her arm, suddenly quieted
and sobered.</p>

<p>"In the Rue St. Honoré, last night."</p>

<p>A frown, swift as a thunderbolt, passed over
Nicole's forehead. She stopped, extended her
hand, and said curtly, "I must go; good day."</p>

<p>Barabant looked at her in dismay.</p>

<p>"What has happened? What have I done?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, and without further explanation
disappeared.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>



<h2>IV<br />
<small>BREWINGS OF THE STORM</small>
</h2>



<p>When Barabant had groped his way up
the tortuous ascent, he was surprised to
find his door open, sending a feeble glow over
the remainder of his journey. He crossed the
threshold on tiptoe, and, to his amazement, beheld
a man, in the uniform of the National Guard,
stretched out upon his bed, and two lank legs
that, over-lapping, were perched on the footboards.
He came forward, advanced another
step, and recognized Dossonville.</p>

<p>Barabant, believing him to be shamming, went
softly to the farther corner and installed himself
to wait. But the steady, tranquil breathing of
the sleeper soon convinced him. With a sudden
inspiration, he stole to the threshold, grasping the
handle of the door. The next moment there
thundered upon the slumberer the cry:</p>

<p>"Arrest him! The aristocrat!"</p>

<p>As though propelled from a catapult, the lank
form in one bound shot over the end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>bed, threw two chairs in front of him as a rampart,
snatched out his sword, and beheld, in this
bellicose posture, no horrid band of Jacobins,
but the lithe figure of Barabant, laughing silently,
with folded arms.</p>

<p>"Tonnerre de Dieu! Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>Dossonville returned the sword to the scabbard,
pushed aside the rampart, and extended his
hand, saying, "I was asleep; serves me right; but
you have a rude manner of jesting."</p>

<p>"I did not suspect your conscience was so
uneasy," Barabant said, retaining the quizzical
smile.</p>

<p>"Oho!"</p>

<p>With his lips in this startled oval, Dossonville
halted. His eyes contracted into slits as he said
dryly, "So that was a ruse."</p>

<p>"If you like."</p>

<p>"Hello! it was well conceived. Tiens, tiens,
tiens!" His eyes continued their scrutiny. "I
have, perhaps, not done justice to your acumen.
My compliments and my excuses."</p>

<p>He swung his bonnet in a long, awkward,
trailing swoop across his feet. Barabant executed
a bow of equal assurance.</p>

<p>Dossonville returned to uprightness with a
snap of his heels, and a certain asperity rang in
the next question.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<p>"And why did you deem the experiment
necessary?"</p>

<p>"Before intrusting my safety I prefer to reassure
myself."</p>

<p>"You saw that at the cry of 'aristocrats' I
sprang to my guard."</p>

<p>"I said 'the aristocrat.'"</p>

<p>"I understood, 'Arrest him, aristocrats!'"</p>

<p>The two men, Dossonville cool, Barabant
amused, measured looks, until, dismissing the
subject with a motion of his arm, Dossonville
seated himself.</p>

<p>"Well, what do they say of me?"</p>

<p>Barabant, who did not intend to surrender his
vantage, straddled his chair, rested his arms on
the back, and, looking him magisterially in countenance,
answered:</p>

<p>"Citoyen Dossonville, you seem to be a mystery.
No one knows where to place you. You
consort with patriots and traitors alike."</p>

<p>Dossonville, facing this accusation, appeared
to reflect a moment.</p>

<p>"That's true. I do not hide it&mdash;from patriots."
His voice gave a meaning inflection to
the ending; then he added, irritably: "There are
more ways than one of serving the nation. I
repeat, leave me mine." He broke off. "Have
you written anything? Give it to me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p>Barabant extended the precious manuscript.
He took it, but before spreading it upon his
knee, he said: "After all, you are right. I have
a way to convince you. You shall see. But
first for this."</p>

<p>He began to read, with approval. "Good&mdash;good";
"very good"; "excellent."</p>

<p>At the end he brought his hand down upon
his knee with a slap. "Tonnerre de Dieu, that
is well put!"</p>

<p>Barabant, who was soaring in the seventh
heaven, made a superhuman effort and forced
back a smile. Dossonville, much amused,
tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come, it is not a crime to be pleased with
one's self."</p>

<p>"You think it will do?" Barabant stammered.</p>

<p>"Splendid! And now to convince this suspicious
republican." He eyed him a moment,
enjoying the surprise his next words would
cause. "Suppose you return with me to Santerre."</p>

<p>Barabant, astounded at this acquaintance with
his doings, dropped his jaw.</p>

<p>"So, do you think I would employ you without
some knowledge of your actions?" He
enjoyed for a moment Barabant's embarrassment.
"Come, and Santerre shall reassure you." At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>the door he paused, cast a rapid glance at the
impoverished fittings, and drew out his purse.
"Republican or not, the essential thing is to
dine." Then evading the young fellow's thanks,
he led the way into the city.</p>

<p>It was now toward twilight. The streets
were choked with laborers returning home. In
the air was an unwonted stir, a muttering, defiant
and eager, as the crowd discussed openly, with
impassioned questions, the prospective attack on
the Tuileries.</p>

<p>"It is for to-night, sure?"</p>

<p>"For to-night, yes, at the tocsin."</p>

<p>"It's true, is it, the National Guards are
coming over?"</p>

<p>"They've armed the Marseillais."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Pétion."</p>

<p>"Vive Pétion!"</p>

<p>Hundreds of National Guards fraternized with
the crowd, reassuring them. Occasionally was
to be seen the glimmer of a weapon, a scythe, a
cutlass, or a half-concealed dagger. Questioners
stopped them from time to time.</p>

<p>"Is it true, we are to attack to-night?"</p>

<p>Dossonville shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"If the tocsin sounds you are. That is all I
know."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>From time to time there were new accessions
in the streets; until, as the two approached the
Rue St. Antoine, they were forced to beg their
way at every step.</p>

<p>Dossonville, his head flung back, reviewed the
throng from his great height.</p>

<p>"What a people! Is there anything they
will not dare?" he exclaimed. "Brave people!
Sublime people!"</p>

<p>They passed through a side street, deserted
except for some straggler hastening toward the
human torrent. Dossonville, in a burst of confidence,
laid his hand on his companion's shoulder.</p>

<p>"That was good to see. I, Citoyen Barabant&mdash;I
take nothing seriously. Men, individuals, are
but blind little animals wriggling for a day
or so. I have seen too much of selfishness,
of wickedness, of deceits and hypocrisy, to be
moved by human motives. Nothing really
matters, nothing is serious. But when I see
such a sight as that, a whole people rising with
one accord, ah, then that thrills me; yes, I am
moved!"</p>

<p>Barabant was silent, more perplexed concerning
his companion than ever, and in this reflective
mood he persevered, resolving to be on his
watch for artifices and tricks. About the brasserie
of the famous brewer the throng was massed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>so tightly that the two companions would have
stuck thirty feet away, unable to turn, had not
Santerre, from an upper window, perceived the
lanky form of Dossonville. The moment his eye
fell upon that appealing figure, he started up, as
though awaiting him, and hurrying down-stairs,
appeared at the entrance, where, by dint of
command and abuse, he managed to open a
passage, through which the crowd disgorged
them.</p>

<p>Barabant, at a nod from Dossonville, remained
in an anteroom listening to the compressed
rumble of the crowd, that reached him through
the open window on the warm, suffocating air.
He did not have long to wait. Santerre soon
reappeared, excited and red with the emotion
communicated to his fleshy head. Dossonville,
more tranquil, called him to them.</p>

<p>"I must take a message to the Bonnet Rouge,"
he said. "It is urgent. So I must leave
you&mdash;only, I do not forget." He glanced at
him, adding slyly: "Is there anything you care
to ask of the Citoyen Santerre?"</p>

<p>Barabant, gulping down his confusion, cried:
"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Good. Then you are no longer afraid you
are dealing with an agent of the perfidious
Pitt?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>Barabant seized the occasion to vanish through
the side exit, carrying with him the memory of a
chuckle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nicole no sooner had dismissed Barabant than
she regretted the act. Her intuition had warned
her that caprice was necessary to counteract her
bonhomie, which might have produced in the
young man an assurance of facile conquest. But,
left to her own devices, to her astonishment she
found the solitude oppressive. She made an
effort to dispel the ennui by seeking Goursac; but
no sooner had she perceived him than, apprehending
the banter in which he was privileged to indulge,
she halted and then turned away.</p>

<p>Toward evening, according to her custom, she
joined Louison in search of supper.</p>

<p>"What have you done with your companion?"
the girl asked at once.</p>

<p>"I dismissed him long ago," Nicole answered
carelessly: from that quarter she welcomed attack.
"A man interferes with the business."</p>

<p>"How did you meet him?"</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you knew! He has taken
the room across from us!"</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed. He seems interesting." She
took her companion's arm and said abruptly, "I
have taken a fancy to him, so garde à toi!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>Nicole, not certain whether she spoke in jest
or in earnest, abandoned uneasily the conversation,
saying, "Where do we dine to-night?"</p>

<p>"At the Bonnet Rouge."</p>

<p>"Why there?"</p>

<p>"It is the rendezvous for the Marseillais. If
there is to be an attack, we'll have the news."</p>

<p>"Do you think it will be for to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there is something in the air that
makes me think so."</p>

<p>Their way soon involved them in a network
of dusky, gaping streets. On each side somber
walls, peopled with dim, curious flecks of headgear,
strained upward and back in a bulging
effort to draw down a little more of the allotted
strip of sky. The windows of taverns, on the
ground floor, were beginning to redden and to
cast faint streaks across the black, oozing streets;
but the frugal inhabitants of upper stories, in
deference to the price of candles, still hung on
the sills, causing the evening to resound with
the nervous chatter of window-to-window speculation.</p>

<p>At times the tension of conjecture and discussion
would be broken by the bass voice of a
passing laborer thundering forth,</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ça ira! Ça ira! Ça ira!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>Above the soprano of women's voices and the
thin piping of children responded feverishly:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"La liberté s'établira:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Malgré les tyrans tout réussira!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>They found the cabaret beginning to fill up
by twos and threes&mdash;workingmen for the most
part: water-carriers divesting themselves of their
barrels at the door with a sigh of contentment;
wood-carriers, with relaxed limbs, slipping gratefully
into the hard wooden benches; women of
the markets, corpulent, quick-tongued, smelling
of onion and garlic; erstwhile actors still with the
strut of the stage; an occasional bourgeois in misfortune;
a handful of gamins, impudent and witty&mdash;all
discussing feverishly the projected attack.</p>

<p>The two girls, perceiving the congestion in
the outer room, elbowed their way to where, by
an inner door, a waiter of exceptional but broken
height was scanning the crowd with an eye to
orders.</p>

<p>"Well, Citoyen Boudgoust, what news?"</p>

<p>At Louison's question, he showed the palms
of his hands, finally volunteering:</p>

<p>"Santerre is to send us word."</p>

<p>"There's room beyond?"</p>

<p>"You are going to eat?"</p>

<p>"Of course," Louison said impatiently, as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>barred the way. "Besides, mon ami, don't you
think we know what's going on?"</p>

<p>He allowed them to pass, grumbling, "Every
one comes to talk; no one to eat."</p>

<p>In the farther hall the crowd was thinner and
composed mostly of Marseillais and the National
Guard, who looked up furtively, until half a
dozen greetings removed their suspicions.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Citoyenne Nicole."</p>

<p>In her astonishment, she turned to find Geneviève.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, child?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I am listening."</p>

<p>"You are no longer afraid?"</p>

<p>"We are to attack," the girl said proudly, and
her eyes snapped with defiant ardor.</p>

<p>"Bravo, little one!" laughed Nicole. "Sit with
us, then."</p>

<p>She turned to Louison in explanation.</p>

<p>"She is my protégée who is coming to me
for lessons."</p>

<p>Louison nodded without surprise and turned
her slow, restrained gaze on the room, while the
eyes of Nicole, full of enthusiasm, leaped from
group to group in rapid, eager scrutiny, resting
finally on a knot of Marseillais near by. One
man dominated these uncouth, bristling, living
arsenals&mdash;a squat figure, sprawling under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>grotesque shadows of the lamp, which further
distorted his huge bulk and bullet head. One
ungainly, crooked hand leaned in ponderous support
upon the table; the other was flourished
above him in frantic gestures, magnetic, absurd,
comic, and terrible, as he harangued his
comrades, who acclaimed his exhortations with
shouts that burst above the ceaseless roar of the
room.</p>

<p>"They are not very coquette," Nicole said
critically, "and not very clean."</p>

<p>"Ah, but think how they have marched, all
the way from Marseilles!" Geneviève cried, in
protest.</p>

<p>"You know them, then?" Nicole asked, astonished
at this side of the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And that bear of a man in the center, do you
know his name?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, with a slight disconcertion.
"He is the Citoyen Javogues."</p>

<p>"He looks like an ogre."</p>

<p>"Wait till you hear him."</p>

<p>"Really!" answered Nicole, with a smile
which threw the girl into confusion.</p>

<p>At this moment a rumble reached them from
the outer room. Boudgoust, profoundly dejected,
appeared, followed by the insouciant figure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>Dossonville. Instantly the room was filled with
cries.</p>

<p>"What news?"</p>

<p>"What news from Santerre?"</p>

<p>"We attack?"</p>

<p>"For to-night?"</p>

<p>Dossonville, facing the eager, breathless gallery,
shrugged his shoulders, uttering but one
word:</p>

<p>"Postponed."</p>

<p>A roar of rage and disappointment drowned
his voice.</p>

<p>"Citoyens!" he cried, "I am but announcing
the decision; I did not make it. The tyrants are
intrenched. Mandat is in ambush at the Pont
Neuf and the Arcade St. Jean. The leaders have
decided the moment is unfavorable."</p>

<p>The storm of protests increased.</p>

<p>"More delay! Enough of waiting!"</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu, we are not cowards!"</p>

<p>"And the Prussians?"</p>

<p>"Hé, yes, are we to wait for the foreign
bandits?"</p>

<p>"Javogues! Javogues!"</p>

<p>"Javogues, lead us!"</p>

<p>"Lead us, Javogues!"</p>

<p>Nicole felt through the child at her side a
sudden trembling and drawing of breath. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>into the center of the suddenly quiet room
lurched the squat figure, bareheaded, bare-armed,
bare-chested but for a tattered shirt. He seemed
rooted to the floor, like a mound transformed to
human shape, quivering in the primeval mold
and passions.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I'll lead you!" The huge fist,
describing a circle, crashed upon a table.
"We're here to fight. We'll wait no longer.
Hesitate and bandy words and deliberate whoever
wants&mdash;we are not such! We have suffered
and ached. We have been crushed to the ground,
saddled to the earth,&mdash;we, human beings, like
cattle, and we remember our wrongs. Fear?
Neither God nor men do we fear. We came
here, we, marching from Marseilles,&mdash;all the way
from Marseilles,&mdash;to wipe out the accursed
tyrants, to make things go faster, and, by God,
they shall go!"</p>

<p>Nicole saw the hideous face transformed, lighted
up with the glow of martyrdom. From lungs of
leather there burst a welcoming response. Dossonville,
facing the fanatic without a change of
position, waited imperturbably the lull. Geneviève
was breathing hard, in her excitement
seizing the hand of her protectress.</p>

<p>"Bravo, patriot, you are eloquent!" came at
last the calm answer of Dossonville. "But what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>can you do? March and be made into beefsteaks?
The people, it is true, are hungry, but
not a step will the sections move without Santerre.
Will you march alone? What say
you?"</p>

<p>"I say they are traitors who would halt us!"
burst forth Javogues, glancing at the man who
dared to jest with him.</p>

<p>"Meaning Santerre?"</p>

<p>"Meaning those who bear false messages. I
don't like these manners. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"My friend," Dossonville said, with cool scorn
of the threatening throng, "you are curious."</p>

<p>"Aristocrat!"</p>

<p>"Am I?"</p>

<p>"I say you are!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"You will not answer?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! Citoyen Dossonville, at present
lieutenant of the Section des Bonnes Nouvelles,
in the past soldier, sailor, actor, innkeeper, a bit
of everything except the law and the church.
Citoyen Boudgoust," he continued, shifting his
head just enough to bring into range the apathetic
waiter, "before this fire-eater is at my throat, come,
vouch for me!"</p>

<p>The hang-down head wabbled a moment on
the bent shoulders.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, yes, a good patriot, Citoyen Javogues,
and an eater of little aristocrats."</p>

<p>"As all good patriots should be!" retorted
Dossonville, gravely. "There, citoyen, good patriots
should not quarrel when there are so many
tyrants to be digested. There is my hand&mdash;touch!"</p>

<p>Javogues stared at the proffered hand a moment
stolidly, drunkenly, then deliberately folded
his arms. A murmur of dissent gathered volume.</p>

<p>"Comrade, you are wrong!"</p>

<p>"Give him your hand!"</p>

<p>"Aye, touch together!"</p>

<p>Above the outburst the voice of Dossonville
rose acridly.</p>

<p>"Dame! mon ami, you bring strange manners
from Marseilles."</p>

<p>"I bring something else."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The way to tell a traitor."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the look in his eyes!" Raising his fist,
the Marseillais lurched forward with the angry
shout of "Spy!"</p>

<p>A dozen men rushed to separate them, while
the Marseillais, echoing the accusation of their
leader, surged furiously forward. Louison and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>Nicole, with a common impulse, seized Dossonville,
and in the confusion drew him into the
hall and out by a rear entrance into the cool of
the night.</p>

<p>"Thanks, my dears!" he cried, once free of
the turmoil, nonchalant and flippant as ever.
"It is always difficult to find the right word on
which to retreat with dignity. You saved me
the trouble. What! it is you, Louison and Nicole?
Diable! if it were only one I could offer
my eternal devotion&mdash;for a week."</p>

<p>"Citoyen," cried Nicole, reprovingly, "you
were wrong to bait him. You have gained an
enemy."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," Louison interposed, and
strangely on her cold face there was a flash of
admiration. "Citoyen Dossonville, you were
splendid!"</p>

<p>"No, I was a fool," he said. "It is very stupid
that some men must be at each other's throats
from the first glance. Diable! I have a feeling
this fellow will bother me some day. However,
it will add a little interest to these quiet times.
Au revoir&mdash;I must be off. If I stay I shall be
falling in love with both of you. What good
would that do? Thanks, and good night!"</p>

<p>In the distance his footsteps grew faint, while
for a time the gay chorus of the Carmagnole told
of his passage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>Nicole, leaving Louison, sought Geneviève,
and, with a desire to reconnoiter, struck out
through the now quiet Faubourg toward the
Hôtel de Ville. There, all was animation with
the arrival of the delegates from the forty-eight
sections, assembling to deliberate upon a plan of
action, while from time to time messengers passed
like streaks down the steps and across the crowd,
leaving the disturbance of their trail on the
surface.</p>

<p>They passed along the Seine, where the river,
as though, too, at the end of the day it sought
its rest, lay still and black, shot across with faint
reflections. They arrived at the Tuileries only
to be barred passage by a patrol. Everywhere
as they made the rounds they found the palace
guarded and prepared; while a hundred other
scouts passed ceaselessly to and fro, examining
the frowning walls, grim in the shadow of night.</p>

<p>A dozen rumors were current: the palace was
filled with Swiss and Chevaliers du Poignard;
there were cannons masked at every point; the
windows were protected with screens of oak;
the court were dancing inside, drinking to the
white cockades, as they had done at Versailles.
Others affirmed that the city was to be set on
fire from the four quarters; that the king had
fled; that the National Assembly was to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>arrested. Nicole, her curiosity satisfied and
wearying of these wild rumors, returned home.
At the Faubourg St. Antoine they found everything
tranquil, and retired for the night. It was
then half-past ten.</p>

<p>In their room Geneviève hazarded the question
for which Nicole had waited with amused
patience.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Nicole, what did you think of
him?"</p>

<p>"Of whom?"</p>

<p>"Of the Citoyen Javogues. Was I not
right?"</p>

<p>"He frightens me," Nicole said frankly. "He
had the air of a butcher&mdash;a madman. Well,
how shall I express it? He made me tremble,
almost with a premonition of danger."</p>

<p>"Ah, you cannot understand him," Geneviève
protested. "To me he is heroic!"</p>

<p>"What a little Jacobin!" Nicole said, with a
smile. Without attaching further importance to
what she considered the whim of a child, she
added: "Well, mon enfant, here is your room.
The half of it is yours for as long as you want it."</p>

<p>She passed to the window, casting a longing
glance at the dark window opposite. Surprised
at Geneviève's silence, she turned, a little provoked.
The child was crying.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>"Dear Geneviève!" she cried, springing to
her side and taking her in her arms. "Don't
try to thank me; I understand."</p>

<p>But the girl, through her sobs, murmured
again and again, "Thank you, ah, thank you!"</p>

<p>"But it is I who am thankful," Nicole protested.
"You bring me something to love and
to care for. I was getting used to solitude, which
is dangerous."</p>

<p>Checking her thanks, she snuffed the candle,
stretching out upon the bed beside the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is bad for one to be always alone," she
said.</p>

<p>Geneviève timidly covered her hands with
kisses.</p>

<p>"No, no, kiss me on the cheek," Nicole said.
"And now, if you are going to obey, go right
to sleep."</p>

<p>The child nestled closer, drawing Nicole's
arm about her. The embrace seemed strange
to Nicole, and, without quite understanding why,
she sought to draw her arm away.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>



<h2>V<br />
<small>THE TAKING OF THE TUILERIES</small>
</h2>



<p>Boom! Boom!</p>

<p>All at once Nicole and Geneviève found
themselves on their feet in the middle of the dark
room. Through the open window there fell
upon their ears a wild metal shriek, hoarse, furious,
angry, that spoke of fire and of the dungeon&mdash;the
boom of the tocsin.</p>

<p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

<p>Nicole bounded to the window. Below she
beheld startled heads in white night-caps scattered
down the length of the walls. As one
dog wakes the pack, another and another bell
took up the call, till from every point of the
horizon broke forth the jangle and clang of the
iron throats of Paris.</p>

<p>Below, a few tiny cries rose through the murmur.
Across the roofs came the thin shrieks of
a woman. Lights began to appear, forms clad
in night-dress. Suddenly across the court tore
into the night Barabant's frenzied voice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<p>"To arms! to arms!"</p>

<p>As though awaiting the signal, there burst
upon the ear the rumbling of drums, the scattered
popping of firearms, calls and answering
calls flung from roof to roof.</p>

<p>"To arms, citoyens, to arms!"</p>

<p>A frenzy passed over Nicole. She leaned far
out, and gathering her voice, echoed:</p>

<p>"To arms!"</p>

<p>She bounded back into the room, knocking
over the chair, snatched up her cloak, bounded
to the window to cry "To arms!" crashed down
the stairs, dragging Geneviève, flung out of the
blind passage, bumping and bruising her shoulders,
down and out into the streets.</p>

<p>From every doorway figures shot forth and
passed, running toward the north. The two girls,
at top speed, joined the crowd. They passed a
woman with a torch, whose hair stood out in long
streams against the racing; la Mère Corniche
hobbling along as fast as her old legs would take
her; families of five and six running in packs, panting
and silent, while beneath, above, about, from
disgorging cellars, from loud-flung open windows,
from every bell the city writhed in nightmare.</p>

<p>Distancing their companions, they arrived
among the first before the brasserie of Santerre,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>where the Quinze-Vingts were assembling, forming
quickly into ranks. From one window Jambony,
the crier, in an enormous red cap, was feeding
pikes to a hundred outstretched hands. The
arrival of fresh torches caused the walls to loom
up like lurid cliffs, sparkling in spots where a
window-pane blazed back the reflection. From
the windows flattened faces with black-encircled
eyes looked down,&mdash;children too young, men
and women too old, to survive in the press
below: unhuman faces of unhuman beings, like
a multitude of rats driven to shelter by the influx
of a torrent.</p>

<p>Below, the black mass surged in, spattered,
under the glow of the torches, with the red of
the liberty-caps, while two banners hung like
huge blurs above the tossing surface of pikes
and weapons. The noise was deafening, the confusion
beyond control. Men rushed in and out,
their arms flung wide and high, bellowing:</p>

<p>"Death to the tyrants!"</p>

<p>"Death to the fat Louis!"</p>

<p>A slip of a girl, clinging on a window-sill,
harangued the mob; a fishwife, astride her husband,
comic and furious, beat the air and screamed
to the crowd to dye the Seine red. Hags with
threatening fists shrieked themselves into a frenzy:</p>

<p>"To the Tuileries! To the Tuileries!"</p>

<p>Some, foaming, overcome with their passions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>collapsed on the ground. The anger of the mob
against the queen gathered at times in bursts and
shouts:</p>

<p>"Death to Mme. Veto!"</p>

<p>"Death to the Austrian!"</p>

<p>Unthinkable obscenities were coupled with her
name and tossed from eddy to eddy. The Marseillais,
gathering in a body, dominated the tumult
with the swelling chords of their battle
hymn that on their voices became a chant of
carnage and a thing of terror.</p>

<p>It was more than a mob: it was the populace
in eruption. All the human passions and emotions
were there, the basest and the noblest.
There were the scum&mdash;the lepers, the beggars, and
the criminals diffused among the zealots, the fanatics,
and the idealists. There were the frankly
curious and the adventurous, and those with hatred
and vengeance in their hearts. There was
youth, warm-blooded and chivalrous, stirred by
visions, and old age impatient to see the dawn&mdash;all
hoarse and all clamorous to march.</p>

<p>The order did not come. For an hour they
waited, trembling for the word. The uproar
subsided a little. The torches began to drop
out: there were moments of darkness when one
could hardly distinguish the faces about. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>cries to advance changed to inquiries. Boudgoust
brought back the report that Pétion, the
mayor, was a captive, held as a hostage in the
Tuileries.</p>

<p>Santerre, the Goliath, passed among them, distributing
hand-shakes, reassuring them, counseling
patience. The Assembly would meet and
summon Pétion to its bar and the court would
not dare detain him. Some listened, half satisfied;
others, the Marseillais specially, cried out
for action. They waited still another hour and
a half. The first outburst had seemingly exhausted
the populace: they remained quietly,
awed at the immensity of their daring. Many,
tiring of the long vigil on foot, imitated Nicole and
Geneviève and stretched out upon the pavements,
forming little shallows throughout the length of
the street. A few melted away to seek sleep or
food. No more torches were lighted. The few
that spluttered on became pale and effaced before
the drab of the morning. An ashen glow
stole over the street. Then the army that had
huddled through the night roused itself, shook
itself, gathered spirit and anger and again clamored
to advance.</p>

<p>Santerre, besieged by the eager, hesitated. He
sent off a band of pikemen and then the Marseillais,
but the rest he held irresolutely.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry started up from the outskirts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>of the crowd. A tall man was seen running
toward them with outstretched hands, trying to
pierce the crowd that closed around him. A
great shout went up:</p>

<p>"The news! The news!"</p>

<p>On the outskirts a hundred hands were flung
up, then a thousand. The sound of a mighty
cry could be heard indistinguishable, rumbling,
gathering volume, sweeping over the crowd.</p>

<p>"Pétion is free!"</p>

<p>"Pétion is at the Hôtel de Ville!"</p>

<p>Santerre hesitated no longer. He descended
from his brasserie and gave the signal. The
enormous mass started, moving swiftly, consuming
its way like a glacier. A scullion, with the
sudden converging impulse toward comradeship
that now permeated the throng, sought anxiously
for a familiar face.</p>

<p>A pikeman from a group, seeing his trouble,
called out:</p>

<p>"Hé, comrade, you seek friends. We are your
brothers. March with us."</p>

<p>In measure, as they swarmed toward the Tuileries,
fresh reports came back. Mandat had been
summoned. The artillery at the Pont Neuf had
been withdrawn. Mandat was at the Hôtel de
Ville. Mandat had fallen before the vengeance
of the crowd.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>They hastened forward and rolled into the
Place de la Grève. It was then seven o'clock in
the morning. There, where they expected the
order to attack, they were compelled again to
wait. When they clamored they were told that
they were delaying for the Faubourg St. Marceau,
which was to join them at the Pont Neuf.
Then these hordes, who had passed the night in
suspense, in the midst of rumors and counterrumors,
sent up a great shout of anger:</p>

<p>"Treachery!"</p>

<p>The populace that could dare anything could
not stand suspense. A panic was imminent; but
firmer spirits began to exhort them. On all
sides knots of men flung one of their number
into the air, where, from the shoulders of a comrade,
witty, brilliant, and magnetic, he calmed
the crowd with laughter.</p>

<p>Nicole and Geneviève, circulating from group
to group, were halted by a familiar voice, and
beheld, aloft the giant shoulders of Javogues, the
ardent figure of Barabant addressing the throng.</p>

<p>"Peace, good, kind, gentle, loyal citizens," he
was saying mockingly, "you will disturb the
royal slumbers. Why such impatience? The
Austrian cannot see you at such an hour. You
are forgetting etiquette!" A roar of laughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>showed him his ground. "I assure you, aristocrats
will not fight before breakfast, before they
are shaved and powdered and dressed. Patience,
my Sans-Culottes; we do not want to stab them
in their beds; give them time to sleep and
breakfast, that we may show them how Sans-Culottes
can fight. They are not Sans-Culottes;
only Sans-Culottes can fight with empty stomachs!</p>

<p>"For shame, citizens; one does not grumble in
the face of danger. Look about you. The moment
is sublime. You who have felled the
Bastille, you who brought Capet back from Versailles&mdash;you
are now to strike the great blow
for freedom, and you grumble. What matters
it if we have waited twenty hours or twenty
days, if we may see such an event? Who would
not rather die at such a moment than live in any
age or in any condition the world has ever
known? Citizens, the moment is sublime; be
ye also sublime!"</p>

<p>He slid to the ground, amid uproarious approval,
satisfied and elate. Javogues, the Atlas,
bellowed out, "That's the way to talk; he is
right! Vive la Nation!"</p>

<p>"Vive le Citoyen Barabant!"</p>

<p>Barabant, recognizing the voice of Nicole,
turned, while the crowd, eagerly catching up his
name, saluted it with cheers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>
<p>"Bravo the Parisian!"</p>

<p>The second voice was Louison's. The two
girls, each armed with a cutlass, sent him their
applause over the crowd. But, while the frank
enthusiasm of Nicole inspired him, there was
something in the tolerant smile of Louison that
seemed to mock his elation. Before he could
reach them, the crowd, abandoning the cries of
treachery, exploded in anger at the Faubourg
St. Marceau.</p>

<p>"Fine patriots!"</p>

<p>"What the devil are they doing?"</p>

<p>"We do not need them; to the Tuileries
without them!"</p>

<p>"Give us news of them!"</p>

<p>"Citoyens, I'll bring you news," Barabant retorted.
"A little patience and you shall know
of the Faubourg St. Marceau."</p>

<p>He returned through the chafing multitude,
and departed down the Rue St. Honoré as fast as
his legs could carry him. At the Place du
Carrousel the mob was besieging the entrance
to the Tuileries, clamoring for admittance. As
he hesitated, the gate was flung open and the
mass, with the quickness of gunpowder seeking
an outlet, crashed in. Barabant, all else forgotten,
hurled himself forward in a blind endeavor
to reach the court. He tripped and fell,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>and before he could gain his feet the mob had
passed him.</p>

<p>There had been not a moment of hesitation.
They rushed into the trap, heeding neither the
windows, bristling with muskets, that confronted
them nor the walls that hemmed them in. Leaping
and shouting, they ran to the vestibule at the
end. There they saw a mass of red that colored
it from top to bottom&mdash;a mass perfectly ordered.
It was the Swiss, drawn up line by line on every
step, their muskets at aim, awaiting the word.</p>

<p>The first assailants stopped irresolutely, but
the impetus of those behind swept them on, until
the vestibule was consumed and the first ranks
looked into the threatening barrels. Still no
sound. The two forces, the machine and the
monster, looked into each other's eyes, noting
little details. The populace, gaining confidence,
began to jest, saluting the soldiers with friendly
greetings, inviting them to join them.</p>

<p>Some one in the mob, extending a long crook,
hooked a Swiss and drew him into the vortex,
amid shouts of laughter. They clapped their
hands, laughing like children, and set to work at
this new game. A second, a third, five Swiss,
were thus fished out of the ranks without resisting.</p>

<p>All at once, from the balcony above, a voice
cried:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>As the sea with an immense impulse recoils
from an earthquake, there was a vast recoil in
the mob, an exact explosion from the machine.
The smoke, rushing down the vestibule, swirled
into the air and lifted. The officer leaned curiously
over the balcony and gave the order to
advance. The red ranks moved down and over
the inanimate mound; of all those who a moment
before had laughed incredulously not one
survived.</p>

<p>Outside, the mob broke and fled up the Place
du Carrousel, recoiling from the horrid vestibule,
where suddenly there formed a bubble of red,
that grew larger and trickled over the garden,
widening and assuming mass and shape. At
times across the red, like a diamond meeting
the sun, there ran a brilliant flash. At every
flash men stumbled in their flight and pitched
forward. Pell-mell into the Rue St. Honoré
they ran, routed, but full of anger and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>At this moment the sections of the Marais
swept in, gathered them up, and, burning with
vengeance at the sight of their wounds, rushed
on to the attack. Barabant, who had received a
flesh-wound in the hand, had barely time to
bind it up before he was swept again into the
Carrousel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>Then a vast hurrah burst from them, a shout
of relief and of battle. From the quais the guerrilla
band of the Marseillais were rolling forward,
formidable, grim, and unleashed. Suddenly their
ranks parted and two tongues of fire lashed out;
in the solid bank of the Swiss two gaps appeared.
A frenzy possessed the assaulting mass. It
flung itself forward, without method, attacking
only with its anger. The Swiss reëntered the
vestibule, issuing forth from time to time to deliver
a volley.</p>

<p>Barabant, in the midst of the swirl, lost consciousness
of his acts, swayed by sudden, unreasoning
passion. He fired fast and faster, caught
by the infection of his comrades, cursing, exhorting
wildly, laughing; but his bullets, without objective,
flattened themselves against the death-dealing
walls. At times he saw, through the
thick smoke, Javogues and his comrades dragging
a cannon forward toward the barracks. At
another moment there suddenly emerged out of
the mêlée the figure of the two bouquetières.</p>

<p>Amid the swirl of smoke, Nicole appeared to
Barabant's excited senses as a goddess exhorting
them to battle. Her hair had tumbled, rioting,
her dress was torn open at the throat, her bare
arms were stained with powder and red with the
contact of the wounded; and yet, as she loaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>a musket, or presented it to a volunteer, or
showed him the flashing walls, she laughed
one of those laughs sublime with the indifference
to danger and the joy of heroism that inflame
the souls of those who hear it, and transform the
wavering with the frenzy of sacrifice.</p>

<p>On the contrary, Louison, among all the confusion
and the tumult, moved quietly, gathering
the bullets from the fallen and returning them to
her friend. Her face was calm, cold; her eyes
sought everything and showed nothing; and
though she moved incessantly on her quests, she
was apart from all&mdash;a spectator.</p>

<p>Barabant, unable to join them, was carried
step by step toward the barracks. Once he
slipped in a pool of blood and went down, his
companion falling across him. He called to him
to rise, but the man was dead. A woman of the
halles freed him.</p>

<p>A series of explosions almost hurled him
back; the next moment the barracks, rent in
gaps, were swept with a sheet of flame. The
assailants, with a cry of triumph, hurled themselves
into the palace, while the Swiss, forced
up the staircase, broke and fled, pursued and
shot down by the victors.</p>

<p>Through the apartments, shattering doors,
overturning furniture, howling along the empty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>corridors, the mob crashed in, as the first victorious
blast of a tempest, shrieking:</p>

<p>"À la mort! À la mort!"</p>

<p>One by one the flying Swiss were overtaken.
Packs of the invaders leaped upon them, burying
them from view, until, stabbed with a dozen
useless thrusts, their bodies were flung with exulting
cries from the windows; while as the
foremost stopped to enjoy their prey, the herd
swept to the front with hungry arms and the
ever-rising shout:</p>

<p>"Death to all! Death to all!"</p>

<p>Barabant, racing ahead to save the women,
soon found himself in front, running beside a
Marseillais, who cried to him with the voice of
Javogues:</p>

<p>"Keep with me, citoyen, keep with me!
Leave the curs to the others!"</p>

<p>A Swiss, hearing them at his back, fell on his
knees, shrieking for mercy.</p>

<p>"Leave him. Don't stop!" Javogues panted.
Seizing Barabant's arm, he bore him down a side
gallery, shouting:</p>

<p>"There he is! There he is!"</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor Barabant beheld a
tall form disappearing at the head of a narrow
stairway.</p>

<p>Up this they rushed, into the single outlet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>a guard-room, only to find it empty. Javogues
threw himself furiously against the walls.</p>

<p>"I saw him, I saw him; he is here somewhere!"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Dossonville! He was among the Swiss. I
saw him." He ran around the room, assailing it
with his huge fists. All at once he gave a cry,
and lifting the hatchet he bore, he sent a secret
door crashing in.</p>

<p>"He is here!"</p>

<p>He hacked his way through and disappeared,
thundering down the passage. Barabant, only
half comprehending what had happened, remained
a moment in perplexity. But the sound
of women's cries startled him again to activity.
He darted back into the current of the mob and
gained the women's apartments. At the foot of
the staircase an officer of the National Guard was
crying:</p>

<p>"We don't kill women!"</p>

<p>"Spare the women!" Barabant echoed.</p>

<p>A dozen others took up the cry.</p>

<p>"The Republic does not make war on
women!"</p>

<p>The mob, balked of half its vengeance by the
firmness of a dozen officers, turned to desecration
and pillage. Troops of women, like furies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>swarmed through the royal apartments, tearing
the beds to pieces, exulting, foul and crazed.</p>

<p>Barabant, sickening at the sight of unnamable
excesses, retraced his way down the strewn
galleries, heaped with overturned furniture, and
tapestries pulled from the wall, spattered with
blood and dirt. Heedless of the shouts above
him, he passed down the vestibule and over the
mountain of slain, suffocated by the stench and
the horror of wide-mouthed corpses. Now that
the crisis was over, his inflammable nature recoiled
before the ugliness of the triumph.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While Louison and Geneviève had been drawn
into the frantic mob which swept the palace,
Nicole had remained outside, joining the hundreds
of women who visited the wounded or
sought, in agony, among the dead. She also, with
a new anxiety, sped among the slain with a sinking
dread before each upturned face.</p>

<p>All at once a familiar voice cried at her
side:</p>

<p>"Help! help!"</p>

<p>The cry came from beneath the body of a
Marseillais. With the aid of a fishwife she
pulled away the corpse, discovering the shaken,
limp form of the mountebank Cramoisin.</p>

<p>"Ah, mon Dieu," she cried, forgetting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>rancor of the woman in the patriot, "are you
wounded?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think so."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he stammered, rising weakly
to his feet. "Is it ended?"</p>

<p>"In thy stomach, I guess, my brave fellow!"
the fishwife cried with rough scorn. "It seems
to have failed thee!"</p>

<p>"You do not know him: he is a hero!"
Nicole cried, ironically. "Wait a moment; we'll
find the wound!"</p>

<p>With a laugh, the two sought to seize him;
but Cramoisin, having recovered the use of his
legs, escaped in a ludicrous, snarling flight.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nicole beheld Barabant stumbling
forth from the vestibule. All coquetry forgot,
she sprang to him with the cry:</p>

<p>"Barabant, you are wounded!"</p>

<p>He looked at his arm and saw it was covered
with blood. He passed his hand over his face;
a scalp-wound trickled a red stream down his
forehead. He sat down while she hurriedly
washed the wounds and bandaged them. When
he essayed to rise, a dizziness made his step so
unsteady that Nicole drew his arm over her
shoulder, laughing at his feeble resistance.</p>

<p>"Allons, this is the hour of the women. I'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>bring you back. Don't be afraid to lean on
me!"</p>

<p>She put her arm about his waist and impelled
him gently. He resisted no longer, and together
slowly they moved homeward over the stricken
field, amid the groaning and the silent.</p>

<p>He had a misty recollection of a phantasmagoric
passage, of rapidly moving figures hideous
with blood, of heads dancing on pikes above
him, of stretchers bearing inanimate things, of
rushing, floating women, of the sudden rumbling
of drums, of companies swinging past him, of interminable
streets, and of cliffs, mountains high,
that gave forth shrieks of triumph. Then in the
city, delirious with joy and sorrow, delirium, too,
rushed through his brain, his head fell heavily
upon Nicole's bare shoulder, and the will deserting
his limbs, he slipped from her arms heavily to
the ground.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>



<h2>VI<br />
<small>THE HEART OF A WOMAN</small></h2>



<p>When at last Nicole had brought Barabant
to his room, she was very tired. Goursac,
whom she had summoned to help her, knelt by
the bed to examine the unconscious form. Every
now and then he turned a questioning look
upon the girl, as though to penetrate the indifferent
attitude she maintained.</p>

<p>"Why don't you say something?" Nicole
cried at last, her anxiety mastering her prudence.
"Is it so serious?"</p>

<p>"A mere scratch," he grumbled; "nothing
to make such a fuss over. If he hadn't been as
weak as a woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nicole, reassured, smiled at his ill-humor, knowing
the mood of old. Goursac, furious at such
a reception of his sarcasm, turned on her angrily.</p>

<p>"You are like all the rest&mdash;just as stupid. Because
a young fellow gets a scratch and you
pilot him home, you call that a romance. You
know well enough what that leads to!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>
<p>"That may be true; why shouldn't I have my
romance as well as another?"</p>

<p>"You say that to plague me. You know that
is not so!" he said impatiently. "Now give me
a bandage."</p>

<p>Stooping, Nicole seized her petticoat; but finding
it stained with traces of the combat, she
dropped it, and calling to him to wait, passed
through the window and across the gutter, swaying
lithely against the roof. In a moment she
returned with half of a sheet, which they
quickly tore into bandages.</p>

<p>"There; with a little rest&mdash;a chance to recover
some blood&mdash;the fever will abate!" Preparing
a sling, Goursac jerked his head toward
the bed and demanded: "You are not going to
watch?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I am!"</p>

<p>"Then say at once," he cried point-blank,
"that you imagine you are in love!"</p>

<p>"Goursac, my friend, you are ridiculous with
your ideas," Nicole answered impatiently. "You
know that the Citoyen Barabant arrived only
yesterday. We are good comrades. That's
all!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes!"</p>

<p>He wrinkled his lips in scornful unbelief,
raised his shoulders to his ears, and disappeared,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>heavily, down the stairs, grumbling ironically,
"A man lies to deceive others; a woman lies to
deceive herself!"</p>

<p>A moment later he called back:</p>

<p>"Hé, above there!"</p>

<p>Nicole went to the landing.</p>

<p>"Is that you, the comrade?"</p>

<p>"Yes, old cynic."</p>

<p>"If you need me, stamp twice on the floor."</p>

<p>"Agreed."</p>

<p>"Return now to your&mdash;acquaintance."</p>

<p>Nicole, laughing, returned to the bedside. She
placed her hand on the heated forehead, frowned,
smoothed down the covers, arranged the discarded
clothes, and, after a moment's reflection,
departed over the roof to her room.</p>

<p>When she again appeared, she had removed
all traces of the battle. She pulled a chair near
the bed, loosened her hair, scattering it over her
shoulders, and began to comb it out, unraveling
the tangle with many grimaces and an oft-wrung
"Aïe! aïe!"</p>

<p>Occasionally she consulted a pocket-mirror,
then resumed the combing, humming to herself.
Barabant, his forehead enveloped in white, his
arm in a sling, lay with his head turned toward
her, one arm escaping bare above the covers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>She regarded approvingly the lithe muscles suggested
under the soft skin, and, ceasing her
humming, pronounced:</p>

<p>"He is well made!"</p>

<p>She leaned over the bed and opened the collar
of his shirt, revealing the full throat.</p>

<p>"Tiens, he's as white as a woman."</p>

<p>She withdrew, and resumed her humming.</p>

<p>"But, Dieu merci, it's not a woman." She
was taking up another strand when the stairs
cried out and Louison entered. Nicole frowned
and said curtly:</p>

<p>"Ah, it's you, is it? Who told you?"</p>

<p>"La Mère Corniche. How goes it?" she
asked, indicating Barabant.</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>"Are you coming to eat something?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm staying here."</p>

<p>"Is it so serious?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, continuing her combing.
"He pleases me."</p>

<p>Louison stood at the bed, looking down. "Not
bad; he's interesting. I noticed he had good
eyes."</p>

<p>Nicole stopped her combing, and a frown
gathered above the childish cheeks, as she cried
impetuously:</p>

<p>"Louison, no interference, do you hear?
Or&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>"Or what?" The dark eyebrows arched
slightly, but the deep eyes remained cold. Nicole
did not answer. Louison returned to the
contemplation of the young man a moment
longer, then reluctantly rousing herself from her
reverie, turned on her heel. Her eye, falling on
Nicole, regarded her with a trace of amusement.</p>

<p>"Child!" she said, standing in the doorway,
her face relaxing into a smile. "You have
chosen the best moment, my dear: you are
adorable!"</p>

<p>Nicole listened, immovable, until the last footstep
had grown silent. Then drawing her lips
together, she seized her knees with her hands,
and thus curbed, her eyes fixed themselves in
intense contemplation, while several times a
sudden anger knit her features before she shook
off the disagreeable emotions and sought the cool
of the window.</p>

<p>At a rustling from the bed she returned quickly.
Barabant had stirred slightly, but so as to throw
his weight upon the wounded arm. She slipped
her arm under him and moved him to a more
comfortable position. This maternal solicitude,
slight as it was, awakened a new emotion in her.
She arranged his hair, and seeking hungrily for
any further service, began to bathe the hot
eyelids.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<p>Barabant, under the gentle stroking, opened
his eyes. The confines appeared to him vast and
silent, the window far removed and small. The
long August twilight invaded the room with the
delicious promise of a quieter night, while from
without the distant, scattered sounds of rejoicing
reached his ears, through the corridors of insensibility,
like the tinkle of soft music. He sighed
contentedly and closed his eyes again.</p>

<p>Presently he said, turning his head a trifle, but
without opening his eyes:</p>

<p>"Thou art really there, Nicole?"</p>

<p>The accent and the caress pierced to the depths
the heart of the young girl, already stirred by
the maternal impulse of the woman.</p>

<p>"Really here, yes."</p>

<p>But almost immediately, as though regretting
the softness of the response, she added, in remonstrance:</p>

<p>"I have not given you permission to call me
thou!"</p>

<p>"It is my gratitude that&mdash;that permits me."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is nice." She smiled with pleasure.
"That was very prettily said."</p>

<p>"Nicole?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Place your ear to my lips; I cannot talk so
far."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<p>The girl, with a smile, divining the ruse,
leaned over him. But Barabant making no
sound, she withdrew, scrutinizing anxiously the
hot face.</p>

<p>"Nicole."</p>

<p>"I am here."</p>

<p>Again she stooped, and this time so close that
her hair swept his forehead.</p>

<p>"You are there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I love you," he said drowsily.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" Nicole started back, blushing and
amused; but looking down, she saw he had
dropped again into the wanderings of delirium.</p>

<p>"He does not know what he says," she said,
shaking her head. "Poor fellow!"</p>

<p>She watched him in his helplessness, and all
at once she sighed; but it was a sigh that rose
from the soul, and while it filled her heart, it
passed on and awakened in her a famine of tenderness,
leaving a longing for tears.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Motionless and perplexed, she stood staring
down at the dim bed, her lips parted, her breast
filling with deep breaths, until at last she turned
reluctantly and sought the window, still uncertain,
nor comprehending what was germinating
within her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<p>The night was beginning; in the clear heavens
the high moon was strengthening in luster at
every moment. Across the stretch of window
lights the sounds of revelry and rejoicing persisted
faintly to her ears. The courtyard, deserted
by the men, was hushed with the silence of fatigue.
The laugh of a girl mounted at times, clear and
playful, mingling with the deeper, good-humored
protests of her companion. From a window a hag,
chin in hand, followed the lovers with due interest.
In another room a weary mother had
fallen asleep with her baby still feeding at her
breast. At other windows the women waited
patiently the return of the men, bending mechanically
over their knitting or crooning to the sleepy
children. There, under the enduring, tedious
night, Nicole stayed from minute to minute,
pressing her clenched hand tensely against her
lips; while within her breast beat tumult and
a revolt against the slavery of women. She
returned to the bedside, rebelling against this
helpless man who drew her irresistibly from her
independence.</p>

<p>"Nicole&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Goursac calling, and she sprang furiously
to the landing, rebuking him with a low: "Silence!
he is asleep. What do you want?"</p>

<p>"If you are tired, I'll watch."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>"No, no!" she answered angrily. The cry
seemed to burst from her heart, threatened by
the very thought of such exile.</p>

<p>She knelt at the bed hungrily, waiting jealously
for an opportunity to ease the restless body,
her revolt forgotten in the defense of her right to
soothe and minister. She slipped her arm under
his body, and drew his head upon her shoulder.
A sigh of contentment rewarded her. He grew
more quiet, breathing gentle breaths that disturbed
her hair and fanned her throat. In the
half-darkness she remained, with aching shoulder,
holding him in her arms as though to defend
him from all who would separate them.
Several times, in an access of tenderness, she approached
her lips to the unconscious forehead,
but each time instinctively drew back from the
surrender. She had a desire for tears, for laughter,
for swift anger, that he should wake at last.
She would have kept him there forever, weak
and helpless, turning to her in trust and necessity.
At times, with a sudden alarm, she asked
herself what had happened, what could be these
new emotions, until at last, in the disturbance
and bewilderment of her soul, she saw the utter
loneliness of her life, and the cry went up from
her:</p>

<p>"Ah, mon Dieu, how unhappy I am!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>The full sun was beating into the room when Barabant
awoke. His forehead was cold, his senses
were sharp; but his memory struggled in vain
to reconstruct the events of the afternoon. His
arm confined in a sling brought back his wound,
and Nicole, and the beginning of the tedious
journey; beyond that a black wall rose up and
shut out all vision. He turned over, calculating
his strength, when, his eye traveling over the
bedside, what was his stupefaction to behold
Nicole stretched upon the floor. Her hands were
pillowed under her cheek, where the long eyelashes
showed sharply against the heightened
color. She slept easily, the lips slightly parted
as though smiling under happy dreams. Barabant
watched her breathlessly, jealously putting
off the awakening. But at this moment, as
though aware of the intensity of his gaze, the
girl opened her eyes, met the enraptured glance
of Barabant a moment only, then sprang to her
feet with a confusion which she sought to cover
with a laughing "Good morning!"</p>

<p>"You have been here all night?" Barabant
said, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Nicole noticed that he did not
address her as "thou." She rearranged her dress
and said with forced naturalness, "Do you think
that is much to do for a patriot who is wounded?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<p>Barabant, displeased with the answer, made no
reply.</p>

<p>"So you have decided to return to this world,
citoyen?"</p>

<p>"Have I been delirious?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing since&mdash;since the Place de la Grève."
As this answer seemed to plunge Nicole into silence,
he asked, "How did you get me here?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't difficult," she began more gaily.
"I begged your way from block to block. Let
me see; two water-carriers brought you half-way,
then a coachman a block on his route, then another
block on a litter, and finally a fishwife
helped me to the end."</p>

<p>"You carried me?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am not a weakling; look at that."
She extended her arms, laughing. "They are
solid."</p>

<p>"And this?" Barabant touched the sling.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was the Citoyen Goursac."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Your neighbor below, a brown man who
buries his chin like this, and scowls. That reminds
me, it is time he should see you."</p>

<p>"Nicole!"</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"Not now; not just yet."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I wish to talk with you."</p>

<p>"The idea, as though I had nothing to do!"
She raised her foot and stamped twice. "I have
a desire to dine to-night, thank you."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to work." She picked up her
possessions and made for the window, while Barabant
cried excitedly:</p>

<p>"Nicole, I have not thanked you. Wait, let
me thank you."</p>

<p>"Why?" She shrugged her shoulders. "I'd
do that for any one."</p>

<p>Barabant raised himself on his elbow and
threatened, half angrily: "Nicole, if you go, I'll
follow you. I swear I'll follow you. I will.
Look at me. I swear I will!"</p>

<p>"What good will it do you? I'll be gone."</p>

<p>She shook her head, and, deaf to his entreaties,
disappeared; while Barabant, furious, fell back,
baffled and perplexed, little suspecting the
awakening that was taking place in Nicole.</p>

<h2>VII<br />
<small>THE FEAR OF HAPPINESS</small></h2>



<p>When Nicole reached her room, she found
Geneviève up and waiting.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, child?" she cried
sharply, to cover her confusion. "Why are you
here?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am waiting," Geneviève stammered,
"to see if I could do anything for you."</p>

<p>"There is nothing. I am going out now myself."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the child, opening her eyes
wide. "You are not going to stay with the poor
fellow?"</p>

<p>"There is no need. He is well."</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;" She stopped, in confusion,
and then clumsily beat a retreat to the
door. "I'll go now. I&mdash;I only <i>wanted</i> to be
of service."</p>

<p>Nicole waited only long enough to be sure of
Geneviève's departure before descending in turn.
Her little room was too narrow; it choked her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>She had need of the open span of the sky to think
over the new emotions.</p>

<p>After an hour of unprofitable solitude, feeling
the need of a confidence which would lessen the
tension of her thoughts, she sought Goursac, beginning
timidly with the question:</p>

<p>"And the Citoyen Barabant, how is he?"</p>

<p>"Why, he is still alive, clamoring for you like
a lost child for his mother."</p>

<p>"Goursac, my old friend," she said, taking his
arm, "be serious and gentle for once. I am unhappy,
and I want to talk with you."</p>

<p>"Ah, you love him," he said bitterly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said slowly, as though the revelation
had just come, "I love him."</p>

<p>"Then why do you avoid him?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of loving him too much."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>She tried to tell him a little of her emotions
at the bedside&mdash;the wonder and the swift, acute
joy of ministering, the longing to tend and own.
Goursac, with a few questions, led her on. They
were now in the Tuileries, a little apart from the
quick throng, the swish of skirts, the laughter
and the hum. At last he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"My little Nicole, listen. Love is not something
that comes to us from the outside: it is a
need within ourselves. We each have our functions
in this world and our needs. At the bottom,
what is strongest and best in woman is the maternal
instinct. Listen to me! You fall in love
when the need within you becomes too insistent.
Any one of a hundred men can appeal to you.
It is the moment and not the man. You knew
the maternal instinct for the first time when you
had in your keeping the Citoyen Barabant. You
think that it is he that has awakened you. Not
at all; all these emotions have been in you, dormant;
it is they, not he, which enchant you.
Voyons&mdash;you do not listen&mdash;Nicole!"</p>

<p>"That's true," she said, rousing herself from
her reverie. Her eyes had been deep in the
bright to and fro of the promenaders, but she
saw only the room under the attic, and felt only
the hot head on her aching shoulder.</p>

<p>"After all, you are thinking only of him, and
I am a fool," he said. "Nothing that I can say
will make any difference. You will learn, as
others have learned, on the steps of experience.
Out of some curious twist within you, in some
strange way of reasoning you will decide for
yourself."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," she said drearily. "But I
wanted to talk it out; you are kind to me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>"I," he said calmly&mdash;"I adore you."</p>

<p>"Be serious."</p>

<p>"That is serious."</p>

<p>"Truly?"</p>

<p>"You know it."</p>

<p>"Why?" she said meditatively, but half believing
him.</p>

<p>"You are young," he answered, looking steadfastly
at the charming profile. "And to see you
is good for the eyes. You are youth, and I have
not been old long enough to be reconciled to age.
But you don't believe me."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No; at least, you do not understand."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She did not return home until nightfall, and then
did not cross Barabant's window-sill, but contented
herself with an inquiry as to his condition;
nor could artifice and entreaty retain her longer.
The next day she did not appear at all.</p>

<p>Barabant, who saw in her absence nothing but
coquetry, was furious with her, with himself,
with all that kept him to his bed. The lagging,
still hours seemed doubly lagging and still with
the memory of the charm which the presence of
the girl had brought to the bare walls. Time
and time his eyes sought the empty floor where
he had surprised her asleep; and, conjuring up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>that delightful picture, he accused himself in his
unreasoning irritation for not having simulated
insensibility throughout the day.</p>

<p>Why did she thus avoid him? He remembered
their first encounter with Louison. Was
she jealous of her comrade, or was it simply calculation?
That Nicole should think of playing
the coquette annoyed him exceedingly. He had
yielded to the fascination of this gipsy from the
moment she had taken his arm in the gardens
of the Palais Royal with the mischievous "Barabant,
you are a lucky fellow," with which she
had opened their comradeship. But this easy,
pleasurable interest had been fanned into a
passionate flame at the storming of the Tuileries,
where, by her fire, her tempestuous beauty, and
her careless laughter, she had impressed herself
imperishably on his imagination; and later the
thought of her bearing him home, of her nursing,
and of her tenderness had invaded his
heart.</p>

<p>With the rapture of the first unfolding romance
he abandoned himself utterly to the
thought of her, while retaining in his deeper consciousness,
as undebatable, that limit of common
sense which must separate the man of education
and promise from a daughter of the people.</p>

<p>The thought was a part of his intuitions rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>than his consciousness; for in his simplicity he
believed himself utterly unselfish in seeking her,
and was at a loss to understand why she should
have changed.</p>

<p>Neither the afternoon nor the evening brought
any sign of Nicole, nor during the next day could
he obtain more than one glimpse of her, as she
departed toward the flower-market. Recovered
from his exhaustion, he set forth on the following
morning, piqued and angry, resolved to find her
and force an explanation.</p>

<p>He searched the Palais Royal and the Tuileries
without success, and it was only after luncheon
that, passing down the left bank of the Seine,
he found her near the Conciergerie.</p>

<p>She was a little apart from the throng, strolling
meditatively by the river, into whose swift flood
her look was plunged. The half-depleted basket,
overrun with flowers, dangled from her arm,
while in her fingers she was turning a cockade
without purpose. Against the hot August foliage
and the buildings weltering under the sun there
was something about her inexpressibly cool and
refreshing to the eye.</p>

<p>The meditative abandon of her pose suggested
all at once to Barabant a reason for her absence,
and with this pleasing thought his anger yielded
to the zest of the eager and confident lover.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>So serious was her reverie that she was unaware
of his approach until his greeting startled her.</p>

<p>"Am I so terrible, Nicole," Barabant asked,
smiling at her confusion, "that you find it necessary
to avoid me?"</p>

<p>She rallied quickly, and simulating indecision,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, it is the Citoyen Barabant!"</p>

<p>Barabant brought his brows together and said,
with a return of his exasperation: "Nicole, why
do you avoid me?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't avoid you; I do not seek you out."</p>

<p>"Nicole, you are playing with me."</p>

<p>She again shook her head.</p>

<p>Barabant, taking her wrist, repeated the assertion.</p>

<p>"Barabant, I do not play with you," Nicole
answered earnestly.</p>

<p>"Then why have you avoided me?"</p>

<p>He waited for her answer, but she said firmly:
"I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"Assuredly she is beginning to love me,"
thought Barabant, and, well content, did not
press the question. They strayed a little from
the Conciergerie, and leaning over the bank,
contemplated the river scenes below, following
the fortunes of the languid fishermen, the antics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>of a kitten that romped over the flat decks
herded together, and the glistening backs of
boys splashing near the shore.</p>

<p>"Of whom were you thinking so seriously
before I came?" Barabant asked, secure in his
new confidence. He sought her face, hoping to
surprise some trace of confusion.</p>

<p>"I was wondering how it would seem to have
a mother," Nicole answered. She crumbled a
flower and scattered the petals on the wafting
stir of the air before she turned. "But then we
might not agree. Perhaps I am lucky. What
do you think?"</p>

<p>"Such reverie for a mother?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are moments when one has such
moods."</p>

<p>"I had hoped you were thinking of me."</p>

<p>"Really?" She lifted her eyebrows slightly.
"And why?"</p>

<p>Her composure routed his agreeable theories
and plunged him into perplexities. So, abandoning
his confident attitude, he exclaimed vehemently:</p>

<p>"Nicole, what has happened? What is there&mdash;a
misunderstanding, or what? Surely you will
not tell me that it is natural for you to shun me
so persistently. I will be answered!"</p>

<p>"I don't; I don't. I will not have you saying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>that!" She seized the opportunity of a passing
party of muscadins&mdash;the dandies of the day&mdash;to
offer her cockades. On her return, Barabant said
more quietly:</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Nicole. You misunderstand
me; I do not upbraid you. I want to thank
you. I owe you much, and you give me no
opportunity to tell you of my gratitude. That
is what vexes me. Voyons, Nicole, we had begun
so well!" He leaned closer and said mischievously:
"Oh, if I had known you would
leave, I would have remained unconscious all
the day. I've cursed myself ever since."</p>

<p>He laughed, and growing bolder as he perceived
she listened without displeasure, he poured
into her ear, in one breath daring, in another shy,
a thousand and one of those vague, delightful
half-confidences which in the imagination of the
lover awaken as naturally as the flowers open to
the sun.</p>

<p>Nicole could not but listen. She assembled a
bouquet and pressed her face against it to screen
her pleasure from his avid scrutiny. From time
to time she turned, and looking him full in the
face, sought to read there the true value of his
words. But almost immediately she would turn
with a wistful smile of unbelief. At length she
checked him, saying, with reluctant gentleness:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>"Enough, Barabant. Your imagination runs
away with you. You do not know your own
feelings."</p>

<p>Barabant, borne on by the ardor of his emotions,
retorted point-blank:</p>

<p>"And you, do you know yours?"</p>

<p>At this sudden challenge, Nicole had a moment
of confusion, during which she answered at
random:</p>

<p>"I?" But immediately regaining her composure,
she added, "Perfectly."</p>

<p>"You evade my question."</p>

<p>"If you begin like that, I warn you I will not
listen. Besides, I am neglecting my cockades."</p>

<p>She unslung her basket and again accosted
the crowd. Barabant, after the first outburst of
expostulation, waited moodily, leaning against a
tree, his gaze lost in the current. The moment
Nicole was assured of his abstraction, she hesitated
no longer, but slipping through the throng,
quickly gained her liberty among distant streets.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She knew that the evasion was unwise, exposing
her to his judgment either as a coquette or as
fearing to betray her true feelings&mdash;opinions
which she did not wish him to entertain. She
had fled, but not by calculation. She had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>again avoided him, and yet she scarcely understood
why. New emotions had awakened in
her a commotion that disturbed her whole theory
of life.</p>

<p>Before, with happy tolerance, she had passed
along the weary road of poverty, shrugging
her shoulders at hunger, meeting adversity with
a smile, expecting two or three attachments, not
deep; delightful while lasting, sharp and saddening
when broken; but, sad or sweet, not to be regarded
too seriously,&mdash;the lot of life.</p>

<p>She had, therefore, welcomed the coming of
Barabant with the pleasurable anticipation of a
delightful comradeship. That she could retain
him, or, in all probability, would care to retain
him, beyond a certain term never occurred to
her. As to the question of marriage, it did not
for a moment enter her head. For her it did
not exist.</p>

<p>A sigh drawn from her soul as she stood by
his bed had dissipated all that, and discovered to
her immense longings, womanly, motherly necessities
which she had never realized before and
which she imperfectly comprehended now. She
perceived him no longer as a comrade, but as
the new need of her awakened nature.</p>

<p>She had imagined love as impassioned, headlong,
and impetuous, and, in the place of this
ideal, she felt only the confident, weak appeal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>of Barabant to her ministering tenderness. The
sensation was acute, poignant, disturbing; the
happiness that had possessed her then was too
big, too strange; it frightened her. She feared
such a transforming, all-consuming love. To give
herself utterly thus she felt, in her intuitions,
would mean only disaster. So she fled from
herself, trying to stifle that immense emotion to
which she had no right,&mdash;so fraught with peril.
So when, through all the rumble of sound and
the ceaseless rabble of the boulevards, there returned
the silent room under the eaves, and the
feverish smile that answered to her soothing
touch, she incessantly cried to herself:</p>

<p>"No, no. I would love him too much. The
end would crush me."</p>

<p>Little vagrant of the people, she knew well
what that end inevitably must be.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>



<h2>VIII<br />
<small>THE MOTHER OF LOUISON</small></h2>



<p>Barabant, baffled and incensed at Nicole's
desertion, vowed that he would be
through with such a coquette. Where pride
begins there is a limit to gratitude, and that limit
she had overstepped. He washed his hands of
her. So, having decided&mdash;irrevocably decided&mdash;that
Nicole had removed herself from any interest
of his, and that it was a matter of indifference
to him whether or not he saw her again,
he determined to bring her to reason by paying
attention to Louison.</p>

<p>Accordingly he contrived to meet her in the
passageway the morning after his unceremonious
desertion by Nicole.</p>

<p>"Salutations, Citoyen Barabant," Louison
cried. "No luck this morning. Nicole has
already left."</p>

<p>"Nicole is out of the question," he retorted.</p>

<p>"What!" Louison opened her eyes in astonishment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<p>"I say, we have nothing to do with Nicole,"
he replied coolly. "Where are you bound?"</p>

<p>"To the flower-market."</p>

<p>"I understand the route is dangerous at this
time of day."</p>

<p>"Exceedingly dangerous."</p>

<p>"Then I had better accompany you."</p>

<p>"I think you had."</p>

<p>With this light introduction, they set out
through the stirring city, greeted by the slamming
of opening shutters, and escaping the
clouds of dust that rose from the brooms of
concierges. Louison was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Well, comrade, and how goes it with you?"</p>

<p>Barabant affected ignorance.</p>

<p>"What, is it not serious with you and Nicole?"</p>

<p>"Serious is a big word," he answered, resolved
not to yield an inch.</p>

<p>"I see, a little interest, but not&mdash;not the grand
passion, violent and sacred!" She added, with
a false sigh, "Poor Nicole, it is serious with
her."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"You imagine it."</p>

<p>"I know it by one sign: she is jealous. There
you are!" She laughed. "She is always jealous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>of me when it's serious. This time, though, there
is no cause. I shall not interfere." She placed
a flower to her lips and shot a quick glance up
at him. "Though I met you the first."</p>

<p>"Do I count for nothing&mdash;or my preference?"</p>

<p>"Nini!" She shook one finger slowly back
and forth. "Let us talk of other things. I might
unconsciously break my promise."</p>

<p>The air grew fragrant as they entered a square
blotted out with tents. Masses of red and pink,
of white and yellow, met the eye through sudden
lanes in the petticoat crowd.</p>

<p>"Leave me now to my bargaining," she said.
Stopping in the perfumed alley at a tent, where
the swinging sign-board bore the name la Mère
Boboche, she cried tartly: "Good morning,
citoyenne. The flowers are very stale this
morning."</p>

<p>A thin, bent woman turned her one good eye,
and recognizing a daily opponent, rose, drawing
in her lips and nodding.</p>

<p>"Eh, they are dear this morning, but you have
brought your muscadin. You can pay well to-day
after the way you cheated me yesterday."</p>

<p>"He is my brother," Louison said coldly, turning
over the flowers.</p>

<p>"Oui dà!" La Mère Boboche dropped an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>anxious glance at her counter. "Isn't he handsome,
though, her muscadin? What arms, what
a chest, eh? Solid that!"</p>

<p>Louison, observing that Barabant was uneasy
under this chaffing, was about to interpose when
a shrill voice rose in taunt from the opposite
stall.</p>

<p>"What a monster of immorality! Allons, la
mère, it's time you forgot such things."</p>

<p>Instantly the two enemies let loose at each
other floods of vituperation.</p>

<p>"Listen to the evil tongue!"</p>

<p>"Hark to the old hen, what a cackle!"</p>

<p>"Corrupter of youth!"</p>

<p>"Cheat!"</p>

<p>"Impostor!"</p>

<p>Louison, profiting by the outcry, selected her
flowers and escaped the fray.</p>

<p>"Now for some white ones and I am done.
Aïe, what a jam!"</p>

<p>She took his arm, and as they entered the press
of the main alley, once or twice was swept up
against him with great force.</p>

<p>"Pardon; aïe, aïe, pardon! What a scramble
this morning!" She was swung face to face with
her protector, her eyes matching his in height.
They freed themselves and reached another
shop.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>
<p>"Thanks, citoyen; your arm is strong."</p>

<p>Louison, giving a look of admiration at his
limbs, began her bargaining. Barabant, though
aware of the artifices, resisted weakly the direct
attack. With a new interest he studied
the liberty-cap that flamed in the black, sinewy
wave of her hair. She was dressed in a yellow
bodice, falling to a short skirt of light-blue
fustian. The ankles thus revealed were shapely,
and attracted the eye with their bright bit of red
stocking. He began to ask himself if she were
not really beautiful, as he watched the figure,
unusually erect, every motion of which was made
with grace and ease.</p>

<p>Louison, observing Barabant's study, from time
to time turned her head to send him a smile over
her shoulder. Occasionally she frowned and, as
though to discourage his examination, shook her
head.</p>

<p>Barabant forgot the curious impression she first
had made upon him. He saw only a face with
great capabilities of expression: mobile, flexible,
obeying the capricious thought. The eyes more
than ever arrested his attention and baffled it.
They opened to him a way; but when he looked
it was as though penetrating into a vast darkness.</p>

<p>"Why do you look at me so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Barabant recovered to find Louison at his elbow,
her purchase made, regarding him with
amusement.</p>

<p>"You mystify me," he said frankly. "There is
something about you I cannot place. What is
it?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Don't. Besides&mdash;Nicole."</p>

<p>"You have been very solicitous to leave me
to Nicole," he said, with a smile. "You choose
excellent means to gain your end."</p>

<p>He had expected to catch her confused and
blushing. Instead, she discovered a row of white
teeth, and nodding her head, said:</p>

<p>"Eh, you are not so slow after all." Before
he could reply, she exclaimed, "Hello, there's
mama!"</p>

<p>She indicated a wig-maker's, where, on the door-step,
a woman of about thirty-five or-six was
sitting, carding a wig. Despite the difference of
ages, Barabant noticed a similarity in the color
of the hair and in the span of the eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Good morning, mother!"</p>

<p>The woman raised her head, but as her glance
reached them started back, as though from a feeling
of repulsion, and immediately dropped her
head.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I am well," Louison cried mockingly.
"Good day, mother, we can't stop."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>She turned in perfect good humor to Barabant.
"There's a model mother for you; no trouble
at all!"</p>

<p>"And your father?" Barabant inquired, as
much struck at her philosophic attitude as at the
maternal indifference.</p>

<p>"There's the trouble, voilà." She held her
thumb-nail against her teeth and clicked it. "She
has never been willing to tell me his name."
She shrugged her shoulders. "That's stupid,
isn't it? Why not?"</p>

<p>Barabant asked her curiously how long they
had been parted.</p>

<p>"Since I was five years old. I only remember
some dreadful scene at home,&mdash;I don't know
what,&mdash;and all at once her manner changed to
me. The next day she drove me out."</p>

<p>"At five?"</p>

<p>"Nothing extraordinary in that," Louison answered,
surprised at his astonishment. "Ah, you
do not know our Paris. She married soon after;
perhaps it was for that, but I think not." She
was silent a moment. "I think she discovered
something about my father: that he was an abbé
or an aristocrat."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I begged. I found a corner in the cellar at
la Mère Corniche's. You have never been in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>that pleasant abode?" She made a wry face.
"There are rats; you don't get much sleep.
Then it smells bad and it is black; though of
course at night that makes no difference. I did
not stay there long."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I passed from corner to corner." She
stopped in the square and seated herself on a
bench. She emptied her flowers and held them
out to Barabant. "Hold these while I make
my cockades. I passed from family to family. I
was well treated. They gave me a crust or a
bone, and let me crawl into a corner at night.
Of course I worked. It was interesting!" She
wove the flowers deftly into cockades, taking
them from his lap, their hands brushing each
other from time to time. "Does that amuse
you? Good. Then I'll continue. At ten I
began to sell flowers, and then they treated me
better&mdash;I shared meals."</p>

<p>"What a life! It must have been rough at
times?" Barabant asked the question not without
a mixture of curiosity in his pity.</p>

<p>"Yes, at first." She returned thoughtfully
over her history. "But I stabbed a fellow who
was annoying me. He lived, but the result was
just as good. They are all afraid of my temper,
and there is no protection like that." She rose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>having finished the cockades, and faced him
with a smile in which struggled a temptation.
"You know I have a temper; oh, but a temper&mdash;a
temper to make your hair stand on end!"</p>

<p>"I can believe it," Barabant said, studying her.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see?" she asked mischievously.</p>

<p>Without waiting a reply, she halted, caught
her breath a little, and drew back. The mouth
dropped open, the eyes fixed themselves. Then
by the sheer power of her will she banished
the blood from her face. The lips closed in
a thin, cruel line, the nostrils dilated, while in
the eyes glowed such malignant, tigerish hatred
that Barabant, with an oath, sprang backward,
placing the bench between them.</p>

<p>Immediately a low laugh rang out. The
features changed from the hideousness of wrath
to a look of amusement, and Louison, again
erect, sidled up to him with a smile lurking in
the corners of her lips.</p>

<p>"Did I frighten you? I like to do that."
Her face had regained its composure, but it was
a cold constraint; she was still pale from the force
of the emotion. "It is so amusing to frighten
people. You see, I am able to protect myself."</p>

<p>"That I can believe," Barabant cried, finding
his voice. "It is unpleasant!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't be frightened; I reserve that for my
enemies. I know how to please, also."</p>

<p>She laughed, amused at his horror.</p>

<p>"And now I must get to selling my cockades.
You can return with me only as far as
the Seine. A companion such as you, you
understand, would never do; it would not be
professional."</p>

<p>Arranging her cockades in the basket, which
she transferred to her arm, she retraced her steps.</p>

<p>"Ah, there's mama again," she exclaimed, as
they neared the wig-maker's. "Let's see if she'll
greet us more cordially."</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped and, with a gleam of
mischief, caught his arm.</p>

<p>"I have an idea. Follow me. I'll make her
speak."</p>

<p>They approached the woman on the step, who,
after the first quick glance, abased her head
without further recognition.</p>

<p>"Good morning, mother."</p>

<p>The woman continued silently to card the
wig.</p>

<p>"Eh, Mother Baudrier! It is I, your daughter&mdash;Louison.
You won't answer? Good-by,
then." Louison turned as though to leave, calling
back: "By the way, I've discovered my
father."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>The woman, with a cry, staggered to her feet,
and, choking for utterance, fell back against the
house; while in her eyes was the wild light of
abject terror. Then perceiving by Louison's
mocking laugh that it was a trick, without a
word she gained the doorway and tottered into
the house.</p>

<p>Louison, amazed and perplexed, remained
fastened to the ground.</p>

<p>"Bon Dieu," she said at last, thoughtfully,
"extraordinary! Who could he have been?"</p>

<p>Barabant echoed the question, while the memory
of the scene sank into his mind, and with it
a silent resolve to investigate the mystery further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>



<h2>IX<br />
<small>THE TURN OF JAVOGUES</small></h2>



<p>Barabant spent the remainder of the
morning in rambling through the markets,
skirting the shores of the river, seeking
everywhere the thoughts of the people, listening
to their ambitions, their desires, and their hopes.
Toward noon he drifted among a throng of masons
who, dispersing languidly over blocks of stone,
were crowding into the nearest café.</p>

<p>"Salutations, citoyens!" he cried to them, according
to the custom of free greetings that obtained.
At the sight of the sling he still wore
they hailed him warmly, asking:</p>

<p>"You got that at the Tuileries, citoyen?"</p>

<p>"Why, I know him," one suddenly exclaimed;
and pushing to the front, he cried, "You are the
Citoyen Barabant who spoke so well in the Place
de la Grève." He turned to his comrades:
"Aye, he can talk, too."</p>

<p>"Bring him in!"</p>

<p>"Citoyen, eat with us."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, join us, comrade," echoed a swarthy Picard,
throwing his arms about Barabant, who,
nothing loath, answered:</p>

<p>"Gladly, citoyens."</p>

<p>They took possession of a corner in the café,
calling the other occupants&mdash;two coal-carriers
and a seller of lemonade.</p>

<p>While the soup was devoured one or another
would turn to Barabant with a wink or a laugh,
crying:</p>

<p>"It was glorious, eh, the taking of the Tuileries?"</p>

<p>"We fought well&mdash;the Sans-Culottes."</p>

<p>"The fat Louis was trembling that day!"</p>

<p>As they fell to eating their long loaves of
bread, spread with cheese and washed down with
an execrable mixture of wine and water, groups
of two or three sauntered in, to smoke and discuss,
among whom Barabant recognized the
Marseillais who had borne him in the square.
Javogues, greeted uproariously, in turn perceived
Barabant.</p>

<p>"Why, it is my little orator!" he cried, and
was advancing with open arms to infold him in a
bear-like hug, when his eyes encountered the sling.
"Mordieu," he exclaimed, "you were wounded!"</p>

<p>"Slightly."</p>

<p>Contenting himself with a wring of the hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Javogues settled his body into a seat opposite,
exclaiming: "There is a patriot, citoyens; I'll
vouch for him!"</p>

<p>A chorus of grunts and a bobbing of heads
showed Barabant the value of such an indorsement.
Across the table his companions cried to
him:</p>

<p>"He's a terrible fellow, eh, the Citoyen Javogues?
No hesitation about him."</p>

<p>"That's the kind of men we want!"</p>

<p>They finished eating, and sprawled back to
discuss.</p>

<p>"What I want to know is, where are we going?"
Javogues demanded.</p>

<p>"We are going nowhere; we are rooted."</p>

<p>"The Convention does nothing but discuss."</p>

<p>"What's the use of overturning the throne,
after all?"</p>

<p>"We must have the Republic!"</p>

<p>"What say you, Citoyen Barabant?"</p>

<p>"I say no step backward!" A lull gave him
the attention of the room. "We must advance
or perish. If we lack in daring, we deserve to
perish. The Revolution, comrades, as I see it,
is not against an unworthy king or any king: it
is to reconstruct society. Citoyens, there is but
one true end: the Nation must be one family.
No more classes, no more titles, no more king,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>no more first estate, no more third estate. We
are brothers, brothers all in one family&mdash;France!"</p>

<p>"There's the word!" Javogues cried, amid
the salvo of glasses and bravos that acclaimed
the speaker. "And out with all lying, plotting
priests!"</p>

<p>A chorus approved.</p>

<p>"Right!"</p>

<p>"That's it!"</p>

<p>"Now you're talking!"</p>

<p>"Curse the blackcoats!"</p>

<p>"What has kept us down all these centuries?
What? Tell me that! The Church! What
has been the ally of the aristocrats? The Church!
What taught us to be content with our lot, with
fetters, with a crust, with the yoke of taxation?
The Church!"</p>

<p>"Aye, the Church!"</p>

<p>"Down with it!"</p>

<p>"Down with the lie!"</p>

<p>"Bah, the Church! the Church! I too was
fool enough to believe in it." Javogues swept
his huge fist over their heads, and crashing it upon
the table, shouted, "There is no God!"</p>

<p>A few mumbled approval, more laughed, while
one voice cried:</p>

<p>"There he is again, with his God!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<p>"I tell you, it is with such superstitions that
they enslave us!" Javogues drew back, defiant
and aroused, and assembling his anger, he thundered
again, as though to bear down all opposition,
"There is no God!"</p>

<p>The laughter increased, while another scoffer
cried:</p>

<p>"Well, if there is, he does us little good."</p>

<p>To this all agreed. Barabant, smiling, added:</p>

<p>"Citoyen, one thing at a time. Let us depose
Capet first."</p>

<p>They arose amid laughter, Javogues's protests
lost in the confusion. Barabant, impelled to enthusiasm
by the ardor of these laborers, opened
his arms and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Comrades, when Frenchmen are united, we
fear no foreigner. What nation has ever fraternized
as we? We all are brothers, all working
for the great end. When we grumble at delays,
let us not forget what the Revolution has made
us!"</p>

<p>Then the voice of Javogues arose:</p>

<p>"Brothers, before we separate, let us embrace!"</p>

<p>With one impulse, such as countless times
animated the populace in these days of exaltation,
the group fell into one another's arms. Javogues,
extending his hands covered with soot, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Glorious emblems!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>Barabant echoed the cry, but as they moved
off he surreptitiously brushed away the stains,
asking, to distract his companion's attention:</p>

<p>"And Dossonville, did you get him?"</p>

<p>"He escaped&mdash;for the time."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it was he? Did you see him
again?"</p>

<p>"What difference does it make whether I saw
him or not?" Javogues answered impatiently.
"I know he was there."</p>

<p>"How?" Barabant asked, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"By the look in his eyes the day I met him.
That is all I need to tell an aristocrat!"</p>

<p>Barabant, seeing the impossibility of swaying
the fanatic by reason, kept silent until they parted.</p>

<p>In the Rue Maugout, la Mère Corniche cried to
him from her tenebrous sentry-box:</p>

<p>"One moment, citoyen." The window-hinges
spoke and a shadowy head appeared. "There's
a tall fellow above in your room."</p>

<p>"In the uniform of the National Guard?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>Barabant, who had left Javogues too recently
to derive any pleasure from a visit of Dossonville,
was hastening away when again the querulous
voice halted him.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, citoyen."</p>

<p>"Well, what? I'm in a hurry."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>"You've seen the Citoyen Marat?"</p>

<p>"Marat?"</p>

<p>"What! you've not presented your letter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my letter!" Barabant cried, and hastily
covering his mistake, said: "But that was days
ago."</p>

<p>"You didn't forget to speak of me?"</p>

<p>"Come, now, la Mère Corniche, I'm not an
ingrate!"</p>

<p>"And what did he say?"</p>

<p>"It brought tears to his eyes."</p>

<p>"Truly?"</p>

<p>"Pardi! The Citoyen Marat has a heart."</p>

<p>Barabant, on the staircase, congratulated himself
on his escape from a bad position, little
realizing the danger of the present one, and excusing
the subterfuge on the light pretext of
giving pleasure to the old woman. He hurriedly
determined to say nothing to Dossonville of his
danger, preferring first to question him.</p>

<p>Dossonville, the greetings over, announced his
purpose with the question:</p>

<p>"Well, young pamphleteer, what have you
ready?"</p>

<p>Barabant replied by tapping his arm.</p>

<p>"I see,&mdash;at the Tuileries?"</p>

<p>"You were there, of course?"</p>

<p>"What Frenchman wasn't?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>
<p>Barabant, noticing the equivocation, pressed
him.</p>

<p>"With what section, citoyen?"</p>

<p>"I was with no section."</p>

<p>"Within or without the Tuileries?"</p>

<p>Dossonville rose up.</p>

<p>"Again! I thought you were convinced at
Santerre's."</p>

<p>"You do not answer my question," Barabant
insisted.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask it?"</p>

<p>"Because, Citoyen Dossonville, there are those
who claim to have seen you among the defenders."</p>

<p>"What's that? Who says that?" At once
Dossonville was all alertness.</p>

<p>Barabant repeated, adding: "If it is so, citoyen,
no matter for what reasons you were present, you
cannot ignore the danger you run if recognized."</p>

<p>As though to confirm the warning, the stairway
suddenly gave out the hurried fall of feet, the
door opened, and Nicole appeared, breathless and
frightened.</p>

<p>"Citoyen Dossonville," she cried, "I come to
warn you! Javogues is below!"</p>

<p>Dossonville threw a glance to the window, his
hand going to his pistol. Then correcting himself,
he said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>"So this is your trap, is it?"</p>

<p>"I am not a spy," Barabant disclaimed indignantly.
"You have an escape by the roof;
the gutter is solid; once opposite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Nicole added; "pass into my
room, through the hall, and out!"</p>

<p>"You mistake me," Dossonville interrupted.
"I have nothing to fear. Go to the landing.
They may stop on the way."</p>

<p>Barabant obeyed. Dossonville, turning his
back, snatched a paper from his redingote, rolled
it into a ball, and tossed it into the gutter.</p>

<p>He looked a moment at the astonished girl,
then shrugging his shoulders, he committed himself
to her mercy with a wave of his hand.
Already from below came the rush of feet.
With a sudden inspiration, Dossonville divested
himself of his pistols and sword, laying them
conspicuously on the bed. Then retreating as
far away as the room permitted, he seated himself
and folded his arms, facing the horrified girl
with a calm smile, as though to say:</p>

<p>"Dispose of my life!"</p>

<p>Nicole, struggling between her patriotism and
her womanly instincts, heard Barabant calling from
the landing:</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Javogues."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<p>"What do you seek?"</p>

<p>The next moment half a dozen Marseillais
stormed into the room, while Javogues, at the
head, shouted:</p>

<p>"When he moves to escape, shoot him down!"</p>

<p>But on the instant Dossonville, erect and holding
out his hands, cried:</p>

<p>"I am unarmed; my weapons are on the bed.
I submit. There is no need of murder. What
is the accusation?"</p>

<p>Javogues, baffled at the turn, still greedily
covered the prisoner with his pistol, but his face
showed indecision and the longing for a pretext.</p>

<p>"Lower your pistol," Dossonville continued
calmly. "Citoyen Barabant, I call you to witness
that I surrendered willingly and am now
under the protection of the Nation. On what
charges do you, without warrants, arrest an officer
of the National Guard?"</p>

<p>Javogues unwillingly dropped his weapon.
But immediately, his anger rising at being so
thwarted, he advanced and, as though to crush
his enemy, thundered out:</p>

<p>"Dog of an aristocrat! I'll tell you. I arrest
you for firing on the Nation from the Tuileries."</p>

<p>"What, Citoyen Javogues!" Barabant cried
indignantly. "If you have taken this step on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>the evidence you gave me, I declare it an outrage!"</p>

<p>One of the band spoke up:</p>

<p>"I saw him, too,&mdash;I, with my own eyes,&mdash;firing
on us with the Swiss."</p>

<p>"Citoyen, you are mistaken," Dossonville replied.
Then realizing the danger he ran, he
continued rapidly, "At what hour?"</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"At nine you have said!" Dossonville cried
triumphantly, extending his arms. "Citoyens,
I demand to be taken at once to prison. The
moment such an accusation is made I insist
upon my right to vindicate myself. At nine
o'clock I was in the presence of the Citoyen
Marat. Take me to the Abbaye and let the
Friend of the People answer for me. Citoyen
Barabant, I shall need you too."</p>

<p>The effect of that powerful name was tremendous;
even Javogues was stunned at the sudden
counter, and sullenly gave the order to descend.
Even Nicole, tortured by the crisis, remained
still in doubt. She made a step forward as
though to reveal what she had seen, but meeting
the eye of the prisoner, she halted before its eloquence,
and, bowing her head, allowed them to
pass. Dossonville signaled Barabant to place
himself behind him, and thus they plunged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>down the pit, where twice Barabant thought he
caught the sound of a chuckle. But when they
emerged into daylight, the face of Dossonville
remained inscrutable.</p>

<p>At the prison of the Abbaye they entered
without difficulty. There the gate stood open
day and night. At the desk, when the accusation
had been read and the alibi announced, Dossonville
extended his hand to Barabant and said:</p>

<p>"Thanks, citoyen. You need trouble yourself
no more."</p>

<p>"No more!" Barabant exclaimed, in astonishment,
for he had expected to testify to the meeting
with Santerre.</p>

<p>Dossonville smiled grimly and, with a curious
twist of his back, said:</p>

<p>"My back itched a little in such company,
especially in that devil's descent of yours, where
little slips might occur. You were necessary to
my peace of mind! Thanks, citoyen."</p>

<p>Then, as he was about to be led away, he
turned to the turnkey and cried rapidly.</p>

<p>"Citoyen, it is useless to disturb the good
Friend of the People. He will pardon me if I
used his name to insure a hearing before a properly
constituted court of justice." Then with his
silent, parted grin, he added, "My true defense
I shall present at the proper time."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p>He disappeared in custody, not before he had
sent a glance of malicious enjoyment toward his
enemy, who, astounded, did not immediately recover.
When he did, it was with the rage of
the wounded lion suddenly surprised by the
trap.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>



<h2>X<br />
<small>A TRIUMPH OF INSTINCT</small></h2>



<p>"Holà above, Barabant."</p>

<p>"Holà below, Goursac."</p>

<p>"Come down."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Collenot is condemned. We're going to
the execution."</p>

<p>"What, at eight o'clock at night?"</p>

<p>"Immediately. I am just back from the
trial."</p>

<p>"I'm coming."</p>

<p>The Revolutionary Tribunal, inaugurated two
days before, had deliberated ever since upon the
fate of Collenot d'Agremont, seeking to fasten
on the King and the Court the onus of the battle
of the Tuileries. But beyond Barabant's desire to
see the execution of this first victim of the anger
of the Nation, was his curiosity to witness the
second installation of that strange machine which
had carried the name of Dr. Guillotin beyond
the boundaries of France.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>"And your Nicole?" Goursac asked when
Barabant had joined them. "Why don't you
bring her?"</p>

<p>"She's not in her room."</p>

<p>"You called her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes." Barabant, not wishing to discover
their estrangement, hastened on: "Did Collenot
implicate the Court?"</p>

<p>"He would say nothing. To do him justice,
he was very firm."</p>

<p>"And the Tribunal?"</p>

<p>"Impressive. The people were awed. The
judge pronounced an eloquent harangue,&mdash;they
always do." He flung out his arm and repeated
sarcastically: "'Victim of the law, could you but
read the hearts of your judges you would find
them crushed and saddened. Go to your death
courageously. The Nation demands from you
nothing but a sincere repentance.'"</p>

<p>"That's well put!"</p>

<p>"Repentance&mdash;and your head!" Goursac
amended sarcastically. "What an absurdity!"</p>

<p>"Not at all," retorted Barabant, disciple of
Rousseau and the sentimentalists. "The Nation
mourning and forgiving its enemies, even when
pronouncing sentence, is a spectacle, I say, that
is sublime."</p>

<p>"Bah! What good is sentiment when you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>lack a head? No, no. These grandiloquent
harangues of mercy and advice disgust me. They
are nothing but self-advertisement. If I were a
judge, I'd say:</p>

<p>"'Collenot, my friend, the Nation has proved
you guilty; I pronounce upon you sentence of
death; for further details consult Monsieur de
Paris. Bon voyage!'"</p>

<p>"And the guillotine, Citoyen Goursac: do
you find it insincere to despatch an enemy with
the least pain?"</p>

<p>"Ah, the guillotine! There is a tremendous
advance in human thought!" Goursac exclaimed,
without deigning to open an argument. "There
is something to be proud of. I foresee great innovations
from this simple invention. To have
learned to suppress human life painlessly is a true
sentimental advance. We shall go further."</p>

<p>Barabant, seeing that he was started on his theories,
said good-humoredly:</p>

<p>"Well, what next?"</p>

<p>"The day will come when society will regard
it as a crime to allow children to grow up who
are hopelessly destined to suffering&mdash;such as
weaklings, monsters, hunchbacks, and the other
deformed. The State will suppress them."</p>

<p>His companion groaned in horror.</p>

<p>"More than that," Goursac contended, "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>day will come when the aged, the infirm, the decrepit,
the mortally stricken, will be painlessly
released from their suffering. Yes, death, when
inevitable, will be made instantaneous, and society
will approve."</p>

<p>"And how soon do you expect this magnificent
idea to fructify?" Barabant asked scornfully.</p>

<p>"In about two thousand years," Goursac answered,
with a hitch of his head. "That is the
time necessary for an idea to conquer society."</p>

<p>"My dear friend, you are either joking or
mad."</p>

<p>"The condition of prophecy is to be scorned,"
the theorist said dryly. "You remember Cassandra."</p>

<p>They entered the Place du Carrousel, where
the guillotine, whether by conscious or unconscious
irony, was established under the frowning
shadows of the abode of kings. The dim square
was hidden by a loose, shifting network of variegated
colors dominated by the bright flecks of
countless liberty-caps, which, in measure, as
new groups arrived, contracted into mists of red.
Above this bobbing field of heads two thin shafts
started upward, nearly lost in the descending dusk.
Goursac, extending his hand in the direction of
these, said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>"There is the guillotine."</p>

<p>"It does not seem very terrible," answered Barabant.
"Let us stay here; it is, perhaps, a false
report. In ten minutes it will be too dark."</p>

<p>Others with the same idea lingered on the outskirts
of the crowd or turned away. The faces
of the throng could no longer be distinguished,
when suddenly afar there sprang up a circle of
torches, and the scaffold emerged from the night.</p>

<p>The two friends hastily made their way through
the crowd until, at the end of twenty minutes' patient
endeavor, they reached the foremost ranks.
A calm spread among the unseen throng, broken
by sudden tensions at each new alarm. The
people, who had greeted the first appearance of
the guillotine with cries of disappointment and
demands for the more spectacular gallows, were
now impressed by the cloak of mystery the night
drew about the scaffold. The machine was no
longer mere wood and iron; it had tasted blood:
it was human.</p>

<p>Barabant, from his position of vantage, could
distinguish the upright shafts, where from time
to time, as Goursac explained the mechanism,
some reflection from a torch falling on the knife
above, there appeared the dull display of steel
like the sudden threat of a brutish fang.</p>

<p>Turning from the scaffold, Barabant examined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>the crowd, where, seeking for Nicole, he perceived
Louison worming her way toward them.</p>

<p>Suddenly a whisper ran over the heads and
rose to a breeze of exclamations. The masses
tightened. Those in front were swept against the
guards as those behind surged forward, stretching
to tiptoe. Louison, caught in the press, was imprisoned
not twenty feet away. This time the
alarm was not vain. From all sides burst the
growl of the mob.</p>

<p>"Hu! hu! hu!"</p>

<p>A long, tedious moment succeeded, then suddenly
the scaffold swarmed with dark figures. The
hooting and the screeching gave place to a burst
of hand-clapping. Barabant, astonished at the implacable
ferocity of the crowd, turned to examine
it, but his eye encountering Louison, remained
there.</p>

<p>The radiance of a neighboring torch redeemed
her figure from the obscurity. Her head was
strained slightly forward, while one hand clutched
the kerchief at her throat as though to restrain
her eagerness. The lips were parted, the eyes
glowed with the intensity of fascinated contemplation,
but her whole figure, in contrast to
the unbridled passions of the crowd, remained,
as during the attack on the Tuileries, controlled
and insensible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<p>So unnatural was her attitude that Barabant
could not have averted his eyes had not the hand
of Goursac recalled him to the drama before him.
He sought in the gloom and the shadows, seeing
nothing, until suddenly out of the darkness came
the shoot and the thud of the knife.</p>

<p>A woman, with a cry, caught his arm, burying
her head in his sleeve. Another woman, holding
a baby, was shouting wildly:</p>

<p>"Bravo! Bravo!"</p>

<p>A tottering veteran, in the costume of the Invalides,
questioned him eagerly:</p>

<p>"Is it over? Tell me, citoyen, is it over?"</p>

<p>The woman on his arm continued to gasp
hysterically. Himself recoiling at this death out
of the darkness, he returned to the contemplation
of Louison.</p>

<p>Her pose had relaxed, while a slight smile of
disdain appeared as she watched the frantic crowd
acclaim the head which a <i>bourreau</i> held to them.
On her face was neither horror nor anger, neither
disgust nor passion. As calmly as though before
her own mirror, she smoothed out her dress and
replaced the cockade, torn by the contact of the
crowd, with a fresh one from her basket, scenting
first its perfume. She raised her eyes, and
her glance met that of Barabant, overcome with
disgust. She frowned, and turning her shoulder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>was lost in the crowd which now flowed out in
widening circles.</p>

<p>"What is there about her!" Barabant exclaimed,
turning to Goursac.</p>

<p>"About whom?"</p>

<p>"Louison," he said impatiently. "You did
not see her? She made me shiver!"</p>

<p>"She affects me like a snake," Goursac answered.
"She is a creature of the night, in her
element at such a time. They say she never
misses an execution. Well, citoyen, what of
the machine?"</p>

<p>"Horrible!"</p>

<p>"You are wrong," Goursac protested. "It
does not take life: it suppresses it, and that by a
process more charitable than natural death. That
is the way a nation should avenge itself." He
repeated several times in a transport of enthusiasm,
"Magnificent!"</p>

<p>"There, look at it now!"</p>

<p>At Barabant's summons they paused at the
gate, looking back at the dim circle of lights
around the guillotine unseen but divined, while
Barabant continued:</p>

<p>"The first time did not count&mdash;it was only a
thief. To-night is the true beginning of the
guillotine&mdash;a sinister and ominous beginning."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>
<p>"Still, what a spectacle!" Goursac exclaimed.
"What could be more dramatic?"</p>

<p>"Too much so," Barabant retorted. "I admit I
am impressionable, but to-night the blow seemed
to fall from above our own heads."</p>

<p>"You are superstitious. You will be telling
me next that you had a premonition about your
own neck."</p>

<p>"Hardly; but, my friend, yours is so long and
the chances of politics are so many&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself," replied Goursac, laughing,
and with a mock gesture he extended his fist.
"As for my neck, Madame Guillotine, I defy you
to take it." He turned to Barabant. "You, my
friend, are so gallant that I won't answer for yours."</p>

<p>They passed into the Rue Royale, Goursac
slightly in advance. Barabant, rubbing shoulders
with the departing crowd, felt a pull on his
arm and heard the voice of Nicole saying mischievously:</p>

<p>"Barabant, are you very angry with me?"</p>

<p>Too astonished to make answer, he remained
dumbly gazing into the teasing countenance; but
at that moment Goursac, perceiving them,
called out indulgently:</p>

<p>"That's right, children; we don't live long
enough for lovers to quarrel. I'll keep discreetly
ahead."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>Barabant persisting in his silence, Nicole continued
pleadingly:</p>

<p>"Then you are still angry?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am sorry."</p>

<p>She said it in such a gentle tone, sighing
slightly, that Barabant's anger held no longer;
still, as a measure of policy, he kept silent.</p>

<p>Goursac, preparing to wheel into a side street,
called back, with a laugh of which only Nicole
could guess the cost:</p>

<p>"Good-by, my children; I leave you in peace.
Love-making is disconcerting to the older generation.
Reconcile yourselves quickly."</p>

<p>Barabant and Nicole, thus left to themselves,
continued arm in arm silently homeward, avoiding
the thronged thoroughfares, the noise and
the lights, plunging by preference down quiet
ways where only an occasional window reddened
the sides of the night. Barabant struggled to
maintain his just anger; Nicole, who had yielded
to an impulse in accosting him, searched for
some means to regain the ground which she felt
she had surrendered.</p>

<p>"You don't answer," she said at last, withdrawing
her arm half-way. "You want me to go?"</p>

<p>He freed himself brusquely and faced her with
the angry cry:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>"Coquette!"</p>

<p>"No, that I am not!" she cried, and seizing
his arm, she said rapidly: "Barabant, it is not
true. You have no right to say that!"</p>

<p>"You have a right to be what you wish."</p>

<p>Nicole, checking herself, said sadly:</p>

<p>"You still believe I am playing with you?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>She withdrew a step and shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, it is not you I am playing with."</p>

<p>Barabant, who did not fathom the allusion,
started to ask her what she meant; but Nicole,
immediately perceiving the danger, retreated
from her serious mood, and slipping her arm
through his, said imperiously as they started on:</p>

<p>"Barabant, have you ever been in love&mdash;seriously
in love?"</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"But seriously?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I was sure of it."</p>

<p>"And why?" Barabant demanded, nettled at
her assumption.</p>

<p>"Because you understand nothing of a woman."
She continued rapidly: "Listen to reason, my
friend. You assume rights over me and my
actions, and yet what right have you? You
have never once told me that you love me. Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>you are angry because I insist upon being wooed,
foolish, ignorant fellow!"</p>

<p>Her reproof, which she designed to be heavy,
weakened despite herself, until at the end she
pronounced it almost caressingly.</p>

<p>"Is that just, Nicole?" Barabant cried, seizing
the opening. "Why am I angry? Because you
will not give me the opportunity." He drew
her closer to him. "Nicole, listen to me but
once."</p>

<p>"No, no," she checked him imperiously, "I
do not wish to. You are too headlong. Barabant,
I tell you, you do not know yourself."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know what I feel?"</p>

<p>She checked him again.</p>

<p>"If you do, then respect my wishes." She
added almost pleadingly: "Not too fast, Barabant.
Be reasonable and I will not avoid you
again." Then peremptorily changing the subject:
"Did you see Louison? She is always at
an execution."</p>

<p>He accepted the turn reluctantly.</p>

<p>"I saw her."</p>

<p>"How did she affect you?"</p>

<p>"Like a snake," he answered, using Goursac's
expression. "There is something about her that
repels me."</p>

<p>"I was afraid she might attract you," she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>confessed, with a laugh, in which showed a little
relief.</p>

<p>At No. 38 they groped into the entrance, feeling
the walls with their hands. The crow set
up a raucous crying, while la Mère Corniche
appeared at the door, shading her candle to discover
their approach. They passed on through
the first court to the bottom of the staircase,
where a single torch flickered in its bracket.
Nicole held out her hand, averting her face.</p>

<p>"Good night, Barabant, and until to-morrow."</p>

<p>The hour, the place, the torch that allowed
her body to melt into the shadow and illuminated
only the eyes, the lips, and the smile that tempted
him with the mystery of what it hid, overcame
his resolutions. He caught her by the wrists
and drew her toward him. Nicole gave a little
cry, resisting feebly.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand you," he cried fiercely.
"What are you? What do you feel? Do you
love me or do you not?"</p>

<p>She answered faintly, struggling against his
arms:</p>

<p>"Let me go."</p>

<p>"Nicole, dear Nicole, I love you, I adore
you."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>
<p>He released her, and throwing himself at her
feet, he stretched up his hands to her, crying:</p>

<p>"Look, look!"</p>

<p>Nicole, with her hand to her cheek half turned
from him, could not but believe. In his eyes
she saw the tears appear, and moved, despite
herself, by his emotion, she took his forehead between
her palms, saying softly:</p>

<p>"Calm thyself, Barabant."</p>

<p>"You love me; you do, you do!" he cried.
He caught her hand in his and repeated, as only
the lover knows how: "I love you! I love you!
I love you!"</p>

<p>She pressed her hands to her eyes to steady
herself.</p>

<p>"And how long will it last?" she said solemnly,
her voice reverberating in the hollow of
the silent hall. "Three months, Barabant? And
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For life&mdash;forever!"</p>

<p>Nicole shook her head incredulously, but her
breast rose in long, tumultuous breaths, trembling
with the memory of the word.</p>

<p>He mounted the stairs, turned and held out
his hand to her. She dared not look at him, for
victory was in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Nicole, Nicole!"</p>

<p>Then she looked at him, her hands to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>throat, fallen back against the wall. He smiled
to her, waiting confidently. Up the dark ascent
was love, mystery, anguish, jealousy, doubt,&mdash;but
always love.</p>

<p>She moved a step toward him, fascinated and
drawn on, until their fingers touched. Then
suddenly she shrank away, and with a cry,
spreading out her hands to screen him from her
sight, she fled. Only the instinct had survived,
but the instinct had conquered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>



<h2>XI<br />
<small>THE MAN WITH THE LANTERN</small></h2>



<p>Then between Nicole and Barabant began
one of those subtle conflicts of the sexes
in which the one who loves the more unselfishly
is foredoomed to defeat. Until the night of the
execution Nicole had combated the very thought
of love. Her flight at the staircase was the last
spark of resistance. She had drunk of the cup,
the poison was in her veins. The next morning
she resigned herself to the bitter, determined,
cost what it might, to have her hour of happiness.</p>

<p>She gave up the struggle against herself, but
began another to safeguard her happiness. Her
intuitions told her to resist&mdash;that the longer he
was compelled to woo, the more he would prize
her. In her uneasy doubts she had recourse to
coquetry, but that coquetry which is unselfish
and pathetic, and is nothing but the instinct of
self-preservation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>To Barabant, who neither knew the depth of
her longings, nor could have understood them
had he known, the hesitation and delays of Nicole
were incomprehensible. Resolved to meet
her with like tactics, he assumed toward her the
attitude of a comrade, avoiding all expression of
sentiment.</p>

<p>Nicole readily fathomed the artifice. She countered
by an equal show of indifference, leaving
him always after a moment's conversation. Barabant
retaliated by devoting himself anew to
Louison.</p>

<p>The man&oelig;uver brought Nicole back. It was
the one move she had not foreseen. It threw
her into a panic of jealousy. Not that she did
not understand his motive, but she feared, from
his being thrown with Louison, results of which
he had no thought. She admitted her mistake
and relinquished the struggle. She returned
uneasily to him, showing him from time to time,
by a word or gesture, that he had only to ask.
Barabant, blind to the extent of the change,
though instinctively perceiving its import, redoubled
his attentions to Louison; treating Nicole
always as a comrade, hailing her joyfully,
gay and charming in her company, but saying
never a word of what she now impatiently
sought.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile events had been hurrying on the
inevitable conflict between the Commune and
the Convention. On the 25th of August the
news of the treacherous surrender of Longwy to
the Prussian army ran through the arteries of
Paris as an inflaming poison. The Nation rose
from the fall in the fury of its anger and wounded
pride. From the windows of the Hôtel de Ville
an immense banner rolled its folds over the city,
bearing the inspiring inscription:</p>

<p>"The Fatherland is in danger!"</p>

<p>From all sides recruits rushed in to swell the
legions of defense. The city, as though the
enemy were already at its gates, converted itself
into a camp, established posts and sentries, while
at all hours the streets shook under the footfall
of passing patrols. Searching parties ran from
house to house, filling the prisons with suspected
aristocrats.</p>

<p>The Convention, urged to abolish the monarchy
and establish the Republic, hesitated. Only
the Commune was resolute, vociferous, and implacable,
shouting for the massacre of the traitors
at home before marching against those abroad.</p>

<p>Lafayette deserting, Verdun rumored betrayed,
traitors everywhere,&mdash;in the army of Brunswick,
in the Assembly, in Paris,&mdash;nothing but a great
example could strike terror in the hearts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>aristocrats at home and abroad. What that
example was, so clamorously demanded, few
doubted who beheld the frenzied crowds that
infested the gates of the prisons, gloating over
the list of prisoners there exposed.</p>

<p>In the midst of these alarms, to the dismay
of Goursac, Javogues took up his residence in the
landing below them. Shortly after, Nicole reported
another disquieting fact: la Mère Corniche
had closed her cellar, refusing admission to
all. Occasionally Barabant saw Javogues running
the streets at the head of searching parties,
in a whirlwind of disheveled forms and rushing
torches, while the room of the Marseillais was
filled with uncouth figures in secret gathering, of
whose character Barabant, knowing the temperament
of Javogues, had no doubt.</p>

<p>On the night of the 1st of September Barabant,
who had enrolled for the defense of the
city, began his patrol at the junction of the Rue
St. Antoine and the great, gloomy square where
had stood the fortress of the Bastille. The mass
of citizens, foreseeing the massacre on the morrow,
had retired early, barring the doors, leaving
the streets to be swept by restless bands of the
lawless: vultures stirred up by the prospect of
carrion.</p>

<p>The hours lagged, and the tramp of his step
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>seemed endless to Barabant. His reflections
were bitter; for him, the Girondin, it was not
simply the massacre of aristocrats, but the fall
of his party, that he apprehended.</p>

<p>At twelve Nicole was to join him for the
remaining hour. There was still three quarters
of an hour before she would come. The increasing
sound of voices restored him to the consciousness
of his trust.</p>

<p>Soon a party of five emerged, preceded by a
small muffled figure gliding with feverish steps
ahead, as a flame devours its path. Barabant, following
them on his beat, strove to recall the
familiar stride of the leader. The patrol approaching
him from the opposite direction cried:</p>

<p>"Is it you, Citoyen Sentry?"</p>

<p>The figure advancing assumed human shape.</p>

<p>"Hé, you are alone to-night?"</p>

<p>"Until twelve."</p>

<p>"You are lucky." He shifted his musket and
laughed. "Mine leaves me alone to-night. We
had a bit of a quarrel. I had to break a bottle
over her head. And now, the devil take it! I
have to stand guard alone." He added angrily:
"That's the way with women."</p>

<p>"One moment, citoyen. You saw the party
pass just now?"</p>

<p>"Aye. Did you not recognize him?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>
<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Some one who'll be busy to-night,&mdash;the
Citoyen Marat." He raised his voice cheerily
and sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Les aristocrates à la lanterne!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ça ira, ça ira, ça ira;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Les aristocrates on les pendra.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"By to-morrow night there'll be no need of
sentries!" he broke off. "It's long, eh, when
there's no one to keep you company? The
devil take the woman!" He shouldered his
musket. "Citoyen, Salut et Fraternité."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and joined the darkness,
while back came the unmusical voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dansons la carmagnole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Vive le son, vive le son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dansons la carmagnole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Vive le son&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The rest lost itself faintly among distant roofs.</p>

<p>Barabant, recommencing his tedious pacing,
returned to the Rue St. Antoine, where the sound
of light footsteps warned him of the approach of
a woman or a child.</p>

<p>"Can it be Nicole?" he thought hopefully,
but his spirits fell as the woman came on doubtfully
in a wavering line.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p>"Good evening, citoyenne," he said gallantly.
"There are not many of your sex abroad to-night,
and alone."</p>

<p>The woman gave the countersign, "The 10th
of August."</p>

<p>Barabant, seeing that she was not inclined to
enter into a conversation, cried:</p>

<p>"Take pity on the patriot, citoyenne. The
hours are dull."</p>

<p>But the woman, with only a slight shake of
her head, passed quickly on. Barabant, thus repulsed,
grumbled to himself:</p>

<p>"She is neither young nor pretty or she would
have stopped." But remembering the sentry he
had left, he continued: "Perhaps it is the fair one
with the broken head. If it is, she doesn't seem
any too eager. No, she's turned away."</p>

<p>Suddenly he drew himself up with an exclamation.
He saw the woman halt as with the
twinkle of a lantern the figure of a man joined
her, while to his astonishment she drew back in
evident shrinking from her new companion.</p>

<p>Barabant, who had followed this scene with
such intentness as to have become unaware of
his surroundings, suddenly bounded back at the
touch of a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"What vigilance, Citoyen Barabant! What
a model sentry!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>
<p>It was Louison who had stolen on him silently,
and now stood mocking him. To Barabant
the apparition was so in keeping with the
strange impression which the girl had made on
him that he was too startled to answer immediately.</p>

<p>"Why are you always afraid of me?" Louison
said impatiently. "It isn't pleasant to inspire
terror."</p>

<p>Barabant excused himself, recounting the scene
he had just witnessed; but Louison, not to be
put off, returned to her question. "So I inspire
you with fear?"</p>

<p>"The expression is exaggerated," Barabant returned
evasively.</p>

<p>"Come, frankly, there is something about me
that has repelled you?" She continued seeking
the answer herself. "Was it the day we
went to the flower-market and I pretended anger?
That was but play." Her eyes sought his
face, as though she could find its expression despite
the darkness. All at once she said, "It was
at the guillotine?"</p>

<p>"That's true."</p>

<p>"I knew it; but why? I don't understand,"
she said almost angrily. "What is there about
me that gives such an impression? I am not
conscious of it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<p>"First, answer me this," Barabant said, "and
frankly. At an execution you have no feeling
of pity or horror, have you?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered thoughtfully. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it is too evident."</p>

<p>"How do I seem?" she said quickly.</p>

<p>"You seem utterly indifferent to any human
suffering."</p>

<p>"That is true," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"It is not only that," Barabant continued,
"but&mdash;how shall I say it? There seemed to be
almost a fascination to you in the spectacle that
ordinarily sickens the human heart."</p>

<p>"What!" the girl exclaimed, astonished, "are
you not curious to see how a man can die?"</p>

<p>"Curious, yes; but the spectacle is disagreeable
to me."</p>

<p>"Why? What is more ordinary and commonplace
than death?"</p>

<p>Barabant, in despair of making her understand,
remained silent.</p>

<p>"How curious! And when I am at an execution
I look different from this?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I seem&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Unhuman."</p>

<p>She tossed her head in displeasure and said
sharply:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>
<p>"I do not like that."</p>

<p>"I am frank."</p>

<p>Louison remained thoughtfully silent, perturbed
and frowning. Then lifting her head,
she said gaily, in quite a different manner:</p>

<p>"Very well, then; I shall take care how you
see me in future."</p>

<p>She turned in the direction of the Bastille, and
fastening her glance upon the ring of light, said:</p>

<p>"It seems to be going away. Perhaps we
shall see the woman now."</p>

<p>"She comes faster this time," Barabant said
as the sound of footsteps warned them of her
approach.</p>

<p>The next moment a bundle of draperies passed
them as a ship scudding before a storm. Louison,
watching the woman, closed her hand over
Barabant's wrist, allowing an exclamation to
escape her. Then, springing forward, she cried:</p>

<p>"Eh, mother! Wait a moment!"</p>

<p>The fleeting figure turned as though stung,
then dashed wildly into the darkness. Louison,
with a bound, sprang after her, but suddenly
clapping her hand to her forehead, turned and
broke past Barabant, who heard only, as she shot
on toward the Bastille, the words:</p>

<p>"The man with the lantern!"</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>



<h2>XII<br />
<small>THE MASSACRE OF THE PRISONS</small></h2>



<p>The next morning Nicole and Geneviève,
having breakfasted at noon near the Temple,
where the throng collected daily to insult
the ears of the royal family, returned slowly
toward the Tuileries through the hushed and apprehensive
city.</p>

<p>Toward three o'clock the long-awaited tocsin
sounded from the other side of the river, then
the chance burst of a musket and the assembling
roll of drums. But this time, in contrast
to the night of the 9th of August, there
came no spontaneous outpouring into the streets.
As the tocsin continued to disturb the air with its
violent voice, timid faces appeared at the windows,
searching with anxious glances the streets,
the opposite walls, in doubt of their neighbors;
even the air, as though to discover the reason of
the uproar.</p>

<p>The streets were emptied; small groups wavered
in the entrances, waiting for the first rumors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>to guide them. As the two girls hesitated, a
woman appeared, running toward them, dragging
a child at either side. From window and
doorway a clamor of questions arose, while many,
running into the street, surrounded her and
sought to stop her progress. But the woman,
resisting all entreaties, cleft the crowd and disappeared,
repeating frantically:</p>

<p>"They are massacring the prisoners!"</p>

<p>The street grew noisy with exclamation and
conjecture, while those above, in the windows,
screamed down for the rumors that flew from lip
to lip. A little later another messenger arrived,&mdash;a
waif of the slums, to whom the marks of
poverty and vice had given the semblance of an
incongruous manhood. The boy came romping
down the street, bare-legged, disheveled, brandishing
a knife. At times he flung up his hands
and screamed in childish treble:</p>

<p>"To the Abbaye, citoyens, to the Abbaye! The
tyrants are being exterminated. The justice of
the people is beginning! To the Abbaye! To
the Abbaye!"</p>

<p>Behind the frenzied boy there fell a silence,
and the crowd, in a sudden, senseless panic, retreated
indoors.</p>

<p>"The Abbaye!" Nicole cried in consternation.
"And Dossonville! We must hurry there."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
<p>A baker's wife, seeing them hastening on, cried:</p>

<p>"Are you going to the Abbaye, citoyennes?
Is there any danger?"</p>

<p>"Not for us."</p>

<p>"Wait, I'll join you."</p>

<p>A cobbler made a fourth, then two apprentices
from a cloth-merchant attached themselves, then
a fishwife and a tow-headed newsboy. As they
crossed the Seine the crowd increased, while horrid
figures of depravity and suffering, vermin of
Paris, broke past them. Cutlasses and pikes appeared,
and from the panting throng shouts burst
out:</p>

<p>"Death to the traitors!"</p>

<p>"Death to the betrayers of Longwy!"</p>

<p>"Death to all aristocrats!"</p>

<p>"Death to priests!"</p>

<p>At the Abbaye they found the sanguinary remnants
of the prisoners who, transferred from the
Conciergerie, had been swept from the carts into
the maw of the mob at the very gates that
opened to shelter them. On the prison itself
there had been as yet no attack. The mob, seeking
vengeance on the priests, had swept on to
the convent of Les Carmes.</p>

<p>At the sight of the strewn corpses and the
blood-bespattered pavements the baker's wife
halted, crying:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<p>"I've seen enough; I'm going back."</p>

<p>The cobbler hesitated, listening across the
houses to the faint cries of the mob in the Rue
Vaugirard. The apprentices sprang forward,
while the newsboy exclaimed impudently:</p>

<p>"Come on, comrades, we must see what's
doing!"</p>

<p>Nicole, who had come solely to assure herself
of Dossonville's safety, likewise recoiling before
the spectacle of butchery, was yet so impelled
by the subtle, morbid fascination which such
scenes exercise over the human mind, that without
a thought she hastened on. The fishwife and
the cobbler joined them; even the woman who
had already started to retreat acceded to the common
curiosity and returned, protesting:</p>

<p>"It's too horrible! Turn back."</p>

<p>"After all," the cobbler answered, "that's what
the aristocrats would like to do to us!"</p>

<p>"Aye, citoyen, you've hit it right!"</p>

<p>"And the women?"</p>

<p>"They'll leave them alone."</p>

<p>"We'll see."</p>

<p>About the convent a loose throng was churning,
bristling with pikes and crudely fashioned
spears.</p>

<p>"Keep together," the cobbler cried, "and
bear toward the wall!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<p>By this man&oelig;uver they penetrated to the
front, where, their band disintegrating, Geneviève
and Nicole succeeded in reaching a position
at a grill in the wall.</p>

<p>In the garden, not thirty feet away, a black
mass dotted with the white of human faces was
huddled together, shrinking from the gates and
apertures that swarmed with axes, scythes, swords,
and barbarous faces more pitiless than the steel.</p>

<p>At Nicole's side a mason extended his cutlass
toward the priests, bellowing:</p>

<p>"Eh, you fat fellow over there! Wait till
they let us in! I'll carve you!"</p>

<p>Another shouted:</p>

<p>"I choose to shave the tall one; I'll make a
true monk of him!"</p>

<p>The priests encouraged one another; some
knelt, others lifted their arms, their voices, and
their eyes serenely above. A few blanched before
the approach of martyrdom, while others in
whom youth's natural impulse to life was strong
calculated the surroundings and weighed the
desperate chances of escape.</p>

<p>All at once there was an upheaval in the herd
of the besieged, a swaying toward the walls, and
a sudden parting that opened a path to the
chapel beyond, where a swarm of the populace,
who had broken through, was spreading over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>steps. From the crowd without a wild shout
went up; those at the locked gates, stretching
their arms through, strove to prod the victims
with their pikes.</p>

<p>On the steps, face to face with their prey, the
new assailants hesitated, seeking some pretext
before striking. But one, more impatient than
the rest, burst from the back and fired point-blank
into the herd. The impulse once given,
the assassins fell upon their victims, who on their
knees welcomed the end.</p>

<p>Forty or fifty of the younger members, revolting
at such surrender to death, bounded away to
scale the farther walls. A very few passed over
and escaped to outer courts before the bandits
flung themselves on the fleeing. Then everywhere
could be seen bodies clutching at the
brim of the wall, tumbling and pitching backward
in the horror of the overtaking fate. Arms
that grasped liberty suddenly contracted in the
convulsions of despair; faces that already looked
on life appeared a moment above the wall and
fell back with the sharp summons to death.</p>

<p>"Shall we go?" cried Nicole, suffocated.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>But they could not move. The scene enchained
them.</p>

<p>The hunt consummated, the hunters flung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>themselves on the unresisting, and as though to
stifle the smallest spark of pity, redoubled their
fury and their cries.</p>

<p>In front of the two girls a Marseillais felled a
priest with two strokes across the scalp, and drove
his pike into the stomach with such ferocity that
the point refused to move. The assassin, in
rage jumping on the lifeless body, stamped and
tugged, cursing the resistance of the corpse which
sought to retain the weapon that had struck it
down. Everywhere the butchers, not content with
the death-dealing blow, flung themselves on the
lifeless bodies, piercing them with infuriated stabs,
as though the last insult was this mutilation of
the dead.</p>

<p>Finally, despairing of satisfying their vengeance
on this inert mass, the leaders forced those who
remained into the church, some who still breathed
being borne on the arms of those who but deferred
their murder. Two by two they were led
out and butchered.</p>

<p>From this moment the massacre, in its clock-like
procession, abated its fury. The executioners
themselves, exhausted and listless, struck mechanically.</p>

<p>The crowd, grumbling at the monotony, moved
away. Nicole and Geneviève found themselves
in the street, packed in the press, beside their late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>companions. The crowd, animated by the lust
of curiosity, became that most fearful of the manifestations
of humanity&mdash;a mob.</p>

<p>Geneviève and Nicole, no longer individuals,
but atoms, became cold, pitiless, maddened with
sensations, hungry for new; invaded by a fury
which they did not understand, an anger and a
hatred of which they knew not the cause.</p>

<p>Some one cried:</p>

<p>"On to St. Firmin. There are eighty priests
there!" A hundred voices took up the cry,
and the mass, set in motion, rolled toward the
prison.</p>

<p>The fishwife, with streaming hair, bellowed:</p>

<p>"Cut the throats of every one. No priest must
escape!"</p>

<p>Farther on in the press of bodies, Nicole saw
the two apprentices, transformed with the frenzy.</p>

<p>The cobbler had armed himself with some
weapon; even the tow-headed newsboy near them
screamed hysterically:</p>

<p>"À la mort! À la mort!"</p>

<p>"I can go no farther!" Nicole protested.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," Geneviève cried, seizing her arms
and impelling her, but half resisting, into the rush
of the multitude. "We must see it! We must
see everything!"</p>

<p>She was a child no longer, but a savage akin in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>fury to the beast enraged by the red flash of
blood.</p>

<p>At St. Firmin's the vanguard broke into the
prison. The night was filled with shrieks of terror
and of furious exultation. Body after body, dead
or dying, was hurled from the window, to be
pounced upon below and torn to pieces. More
than eighty lay quivering in mounds.</p>

<p>Then at last the mob, by that strange organization
by which it moves without commands,
turned face and, sparkling with torches, inundated
the narrow street that led down to the
Boulevard St. Germain, and returned to the prison
of the Abbaye. It was now deep into the night,
and for hours a semblance of a trial had been
going on within the court. The mob, thus balked
by the routine of justice, softened and dissipated
into a throng of spectators, bewildered and recovering
slowly from their delirium.</p>

<p>Nicole, fearing for Dossonville, pressed forward
for a nearer view. About the gates were a score
of executioners, so saturated with blood that at
first glance the butchers seemed more like the
butchered. Eight or ten waited in two rows the
arrival of the new victim. As many more leaned
wearily against the wall with nodding heads.
One stooped to light fresh torches.</p>

<p>Suddenly the gates disclosed to Nicole the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>flaring courtyard and the wild figure of a prisoner
propelled to destruction by two guards. At first
he marched to his death with firm tread; but
all at once, with a horrid heave of his breast,
he stretched out his hands before his face to hide
the hideous doom. Shoved forward, his arms
raised in the instinct of self-preservation, he
suffered untold tortures: his arms, hacked to
spouting stumps, received a dozen gashes, while
the revolting body sought to strike back against
the sting, until the last blow silenced the shriek
on shriek that called on merciful death.</p>

<p>Two men dragged aside the half-naked corpse
and flung it on the mound of bodies. At
the shock of the new arrival there was a sudden
settling and shifting in this inert mass, a
quivering adjustment that gave the ghastly semblance
of life, as though a hideous welcome of
the dead to the dead. Geneviève, with throbbing
pulses and dilated nostrils, shuddered and
turned to Nicole. She was so rigid, so ghastly
with the horror, that Geneviève seized her arm.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah! ah!"</p>

<p>At her clutch Nicole screamed in mortal dread,
then burst into hysterical weeping. Geneviève
put her arm around her and drew her away,
through the morbid crowd, seeing dimly the
baker's wife pressing feverishly forward to seize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>their place. Then Nicole, covering her eyes,
began to scream:</p>

<p>"Take me away, away, away!"</p>

<p>But at every tenth step she stopped and
struggled to go back, her glance seeking the
caldron. The third time, to her horror, the
gates opened once more, and, heavily borne between
two guards, she saw the figure of Dossonville.</p>

<h2>XIII<br />
<small>DOSSONVILLE IN PERIL</small></h2>




<p>"The Citoyen Dossonville to the bar! The
Citoyen Dos-son-ville!"</p>

<p>The call, resounding along the stone corridors,
reached the prisoners huddled in the main hall
of the Abbaye.</p>

<p>"The Citoyen Dos-son-ville!"</p>

<p>A turnkey under a snarling torch penetrated
the group, drawing one after another to him with
rough hand.</p>

<p>"The Citoyen Dossonville! I summon all on
peril of their lives to discover to me the Citoyen
Dossonville!"</p>

<p>Out of the mass extended a hand with long,
accusing forefinger, and a voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Over there."</p>

<p>The hand was snatched back, while a fomenting
in the crowd showed where the informer
was burying himself from recognition.</p>

<p>The turnkey stopped before a figure stretched
in sleep, and incredulously thrust his torch into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>the face. But the sleeper continued to inhale
long breaths methodically, until, convinced of
the genuineness of the sleep, the turnkey proceeded
to wake him with a vigorous thrust of
his foot.</p>

<p>Dossonville started to a sitting position, opening
his eyes on the suspicious visage above
him and the background of fellow-prisoners who,
afraid to show too much interest, held themselves
at a distance and followed from the corners of
their eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?"</p>

<p>"Are you the Citoyen Dossonville?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"The Nation summons you to appear before
the bar of the popular justice!"</p>

<p>"At eleven o'clock at night? The justice of
the people never sleeps, then?"</p>

<p>"Be quick!"</p>

<p>Dossonville lifted himself to an upright position,
restoring his pillow to its rightful function
of cloak.</p>

<p>"I will not bother about my other possessions
now," he cried sarcastically. "Citoyennes and
citoyens, to the pleasure of seeing you again,
or not, as you prefer. Now for the justice of the
people!"</p>

<p>Under the lightness of his manner, his mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>worked with the desperation of an animal at
bay. Of what he was approaching he knew
nothing. Yet as he advanced along the reverberant
corridors, his mind assembled a dozen
stratagems to meet either a whirlwind of assassins
or the travesty of a trial. His eye, meanwhile
alert for every detail, enveloped each portion of
the journey at a glance, running the walls as a
wild animal tracks his cage.</p>

<p>Gradually his waiting ear distinguished a
muffled hum, a buzz of voices, increasing in
volume until out of it escaped the piercing shriek
of a woman.</p>

<p>The next moment there burst upon his hearing
a hundred cries,&mdash;shrieks of terror, shouts of vengeance,
cries of pity, commands and groans,
drunken and maddened notes,&mdash;sharp to the ear,
rushing over his mind in a storm of confusion.
The gate opened and the volume smote him
with the fury of a blast.</p>

<p>He stood in the courtyard, blinking at strange
forms and the crossing and recrossing of torches,
striving to collect his wits. Two guards had
seized him, presenting the points of their reddened
swords to his breast.</p>

<p>His eye went to the center of the courtyard,
to a table flanked by torches, littered with papers,
bottles, and the glint of steel; behind which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>installed as judge, Dossonville recognized the
huissier Maillard. A score of Marseillais, stained
with blood, reeling from sleep or drunkenness,
churned about this improvised tribunal, interrupting
with their revilings the testimony of
the accused, or swaggered back and forth through
the gate that led to the mob. Some clustered
in corners to drink from the bottles that a wine-merchant
constantly renewed; others nonchalantly
lighted pipes, stretched their arms and yawned.
In the lull between executions Dossonville heard
a snore. Amid this carnage one man, stretched
on a bench, was unconcernedly asleep.</p>

<p>"There's a man who's not disturbed by trifles,"
he muttered.</p>

<p>At the slight shift he made, one of his guards
pricked him with his sword, crying angrily:</p>

<p>"Move again, and I'll cut you to ribbons!"</p>

<p>"I am become a statue," Dossonville answered
coolly. "Only, do not bear too hard. I am
ticklish."</p>

<p>Ahead of him, a priest without hope told
his beads; while before the tribunal was a man
so bowed with years that he had to be supported
on either side.</p>

<p>All at once, seeking in the crowd, Dossonville
perceived Javogues.</p>

<p>"Aïe! aïe!" he mumbled uneasily at the sight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>of that gloating face. "What ferocity! He is
bound to make sure of me. The animal!"</p>

<p>He turned stoically from the Marseillais to
the judges, where, to his amazement, he perceived
a movement of clemency toward the accused.
Suddenly the voice of Maillard appealed to the
crowd:</p>

<p>"Citoyens, whatever the condition or the crimes
of this feeble plaything of time, I declare to you that
it is unworthy of the Republic to pursue here its
vengeance! When nature, for eighty years, has
spared one from peril of sickness, shock of accident,
and the din of battles, man cannot show
himself more pitiless than nature. Citoyens, I demand
the handful of years for this venerable
man."</p>

<p>An approving murmur saluted this oratorical
appeal, broken by the strident voice of Javogues:</p>

<p>"Traitors have no age. If he is an aristocrat,
let him die!"</p>

<p>Maillard, encouraged by the cries of dissent,
extended his arm over the broken figure and
said impressively:</p>

<p>"Whatever this man has been, exists no more.
The Republic can take no vengeance here, for it
can deprive this man of nothing. Citoyens, let
him be acquitted."</p>

<p>"Well said."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>"He speaks well."</p>

<p>"Free him!"</p>

<p>"Bravo. Free him!"</p>

<p>The acquitted man, aware of what had happened,
was led away by the guards. The priest
was put in his place, Dossonville moving nearer.</p>

<p>But now the executioners without the gates,
growing impatient, smote the air with their cries:</p>

<p>"More victims!"</p>

<p>"Hurry up!"</p>

<p>"No ceremony with the aristocrat!"</p>

<p>"Hurry up! More! More!"</p>

<p>"Give us more! We want more!"</p>

<p>"Maillard, we are thirsty!"</p>

<p>The judge, addressing the quiet victim, proceeded
methodically:</p>

<p>"Jean Marie Latour?"</p>

<p>"I am he."</p>

<p>"Called Brother Francis?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Priest?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You refused the oath of allegiance to the
Nation?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>At this a howl more of triumph than of anger
burst from the listeners, and the judge, recognizing
the hopelessness of the case, said shortly:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>"To La Force."</p>

<p>Three men seized him and bore him, unresisting,
to the shambles, while two more propelled
Dossonville roughly forward.</p>

<p>Hardly was he in position when three piercing
shrieks announced the death of the priest. Dossonville,
shuddering despite his will, heard a voice
cry boisterously:</p>

<p>"Eh, what a squeal the animal gave!"</p>

<p>The guards fell back, guarding his retreat, while
Dossonville, disdaining to notice, felt rather than
saw the Marseillais take his position at his side.</p>

<p>"Armand Roger Dossonville?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"Lieutenant in the National Guard?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are accused of being in the Tuileries on
the tenth day of August and of firing upon the
Nation."</p>

<p>"Who accuses me?"</p>

<p>"I accuse you."</p>

<p>"And I."</p>

<p>Dossonville turned, met the angry eyes of
Javogues, and seeking the second speaker, recognized
one of those who had arrested him. He
turned to the tribunal.</p>

<p>"The witnesses are mistaken. I was not at
the Tuileries."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>
<p>His accusers burst into a roar of denunciation,
but Maillard, quelling them, said quietly:</p>

<p>"That should not be difficult to prove. With
whom were you on the tenth day of August?"</p>

<p>Dossonville nodded his head in assent. Then,
seeing the trap into which he was being led, he
asked:</p>

<p>"First, does not that register relate that on my
arrest I claimed an alibi with the Citoyen Marat
and later renounced it at this prison, giving as a
reason that I used it as a protection to insure my
reaching prison and a trial?"</p>

<p>Javogues broke in furiously:</p>

<p>"Do not listen to him! He prepares some
new lie!" Then grasping Dossonville by the
collar, he shook his fist in his face. "I swear
that if he is acquitted, I myself will cut his
throat."</p>

<p>"The Citoyen Javogues," Dossonville continued,
without changing the level of his voice,
"unfortunately for me, from the day we met has
hated me with an obstinate hatred. I adopted
the subterfuge only because I believed that otherwise
I never could have reached the prison alive.
The proof is, I denounced it immediately and
explained my reasons. You will find it there.
I will now tell you with whom I passed the
day."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<p>He waited a moment for quiet, Javogues
thundering:</p>

<p>"He lies! He lies! He lies!"</p>

<p>"The man whose testimony I invoke is known
to you, Citoyen Maillard. Of his patriotism
there can be no question. Unfortunately, he left
immediately after for the Army of the Rhone.
From ten o'clock of the night of August 9th
until ten o'clock of the morning of August 10th
I was in the house of the Citoyen Héron."</p>

<p>There was a movement of stupefaction in the
assemblage, even Javogues recoiling. But the
first words of Maillard fell upon the ears of Dossonville
as the sudden fall of a sword.</p>

<p>"The Citoyen Héron did not leave for the
frontier. Let the Citoyen Héron be roused and
corroborate the accused!"</p>

<p>Two or three threw themselves upon the sleeper
to bring him forward. The mind of Dossonville,
thus faced with certain defeat, did not give a second
to despair, but, with the last instinctive
grasping for life, gathered for a supreme effort.</p>

<p>"It is unnecessary," he cried hurriedly. "That
night I performed secret services to the Nation
that cannot be made public. But my life is at
stake; I demand Santerre. Santerre will vouch
for me."</p>

<p>But what he said was lost in the chorus:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>"Spy!"</p>

<p>"Liar!"</p>

<p>"Traitor!"</p>

<p>"Liar! Liar!"</p>

<p>"Santerre now!"</p>

<p>"Robespierre next!"</p>

<p>"He was nursing Danton, perhaps!"</p>

<p>Dossonville stretched out his hand appealingly,
but recognizing, himself, the impossibility of his
position, he changed the gesture into one of command,
and looking Maillard calmly in the face,
said:</p>

<p>"Well, hurry it up then!"</p>

<p>"To La Force!"</p>

<p>Dossonville, wheeling to meet his escorts, found
himself face to face with Javogues.</p>

<p>"Ah, traitor," the Marseillais cried, planting
himself in his path with folded arms, "have I
caught you at last?"</p>

<p>With a sneer, he turned contemptuously on
his heel, while Dossonville, seized by his two
guards, began the fatal journey. Already from
the gates savage faces peered in expectation,
while from the courtyard cries of warning
arose:</p>

<p>"Another! Another!"</p>

<p>"Make ready, comrades!"</p>

<p>"A tall one this time!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>
<p>"Make ready!"</p>

<p>Half-way to the gate, Dossonville stumbled and
went down, sprawling. Instantly he was up, but
catching at the arms of his guards, who, trying to
shake him off, cried:</p>

<p>"Let go, there, or I'll stab you."</p>

<p>"Citoyen," answered Dossonville with an exclamation
of pain&mdash;"Citoyen, I have turned my
ankle. Support me!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, no nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Citoyen, it is because I do not wish to appear
to shrink. Remember that I am a Frenchman;
I desire only to die bravely. Give me your
support."</p>

<p>"Give it to him!" growled the other.</p>

<p>"Citoyen, I thank you; unfortunately, we shall
not meet again."</p>

<p>The one who had spoken continued gruffly:</p>

<p>"When you pass through the gate keep your
hands behind your back; you'll suffer less."</p>

<p>"Thanks again."</p>

<p>The next moment the door of the human furnace
flung open upon his eyes the horrid spectacle
of dead and living: of the living more horrible
than the dead.</p>

<p>"One step more!"</p>

<p>The butchers, but five deep, seeing a man borne
to them by their comrades, relaxed their tension;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>those farthest away even lowering their dripping
blades.</p>

<p>"There, citoyens, steady me one moment."</p>

<p>With a sudden powerful lunge Dossonville
threw the two guards back and leaped headlong
into the gauntlet, pierced it, bounded across the
open, and dove headlong into the friendly crowd,
disappearing like an enormous fish, with only
an eddy in the crowd to show his passage.</p>

<h2>XIV<br />
<small>GOURSAC AS ACCUSER</small></h2>



<p>For two days, while the massacre ran its
course, Paris, in terror of a few hundred
assassins, was silent and empty. Bands of marauders
scoured the streets, robbing and pillaging
under pretext of the right of search. No
shops were opened, all industry was suspended,
while the law-abiding occupied themselves with
fortifying their doors against immediate assault.</p>

<p>Nicole, broken with the horror of her experience,
remained in her room, in utter collapse.
Barabant, who likewise was ignorant of the escape
of Dossonville, sick at heart, passed the day in the
room of Goursac, mourning the fall of the Revolution
of Ideas. Louison, alone of all the court,
ventured out, bringing back such tales of the ferocity
of Javogues that Goursac in his anger
vowed that he would strike him down. The day
was pervaded with the stillness of night. Across
the roof arrived the faint traveling cries of victims;
beyond that, the air was empty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>After three days of butchery, came the reaction.
The assassins, after slaughtering indiscriminately
women, children, old men, priests, forgers, and
other criminals, blinded with lust of blood, hurled
themselves on La Correction, where the children
of the people were confined, maltreated and
covered with vermin. Thirty-three were led out
and put to death.</p>

<p>Then at last Paris revolted. The Commune,
itself horrified, rose up and ended the slaughter.
On all sides the nursed wrath of the people exploded
in cries of vengeance, as they thronged to
the section-halls with angry denunciations and
demands for prosecution.</p>

<p>After two days of fever and stupor, haunted by
visions of the mocking face of Louison and of
Barabant, Nicole made an effort, and rising from
her bed, set out for the section-hall in the company
of Geneviève. When they had entered
the hot, choked hall and had taken seats, they
found Goursac at the tribune stirring the assembly
with pictures of the massacre of women
and children. The audience, relieved of
its personal fear, vented its anger in wild cries
for vengeance. Goursac, having demanded the
arrest and condemnation of the Terrorists, descended.</p>

<p>Across the boisterous hall Nicole beheld, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>a sudden thrill, Barabant springing impetuously
to take his place. But as he reached the
tribune and turned to address the crowd, her
eyes, which had followed his every movement,
were distracted by a violent interruption at the
entrance. A cry of indignant anger exploded from
the crowd, a cry of despair from Geneviève, whose
fingers buried themselves in Nicole's arm; and Nicole,
seeking through the overheated, clamorous
atmosphere, beheld, flanked by two companions,
the wild figure of Javogues.</p>

<p>The crowd, taken unawares, remained vacillating;
while the Marseillais, confident of his reception,
advanced, and lifting his hideous arms,
shouted:</p>

<p>"Citoyens, behold the blood of traitors and
rejoice!"</p>

<p>No answering shout was returned.</p>

<p>"Citoyens, France has been purged of its tyrants!"</p>

<p>Nicole, shrinking from the horror of the Marseillais,
was yet fascinated by his scornful courage.</p>

<p>For a moment the individual dominated the
mass, as yet divided, awaiting the moment that
should produce its leader. From somewhere in
the back came the answer:</p>

<p>"And La Correction? Is the blood of children
also on your arms?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p>At this solemn denunciation, Javogues, for the
first time realizing his danger, drew back a step,
seeking the speaker in the craning of the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Butcher! look this way! It is I&mdash;the Citoyen
Goursac&mdash;who challenge you."</p>

<p>With a sweep of his arms, Goursac freed himself
and began a zigzag descent down the benches
toward his enemy, pausing at every step to cry:</p>

<p>"Butcher! Assassin! Cutthroat!"</p>

<p>Javogues, watching his approach, was at first
too astounded to gather his senses; but when
Goursac, piercing the last rows, emerged with
accusing finger, Javogues advanced a step and
closed a hand over his knife.</p>

<p>The mass, watching every motion of these
two men, with one movement of its hundred
arms loosened its weapons. The action unified
it. It became an organism, hostile, menacing,
and alert for the first outburst.</p>

<p>Goursac, gathering anger as he advanced, cried:</p>

<p>"Assassin of children! butcher of women!
murderer! cutthroat! do you dare to show
yourself in this assembly?"</p>

<p>Javogues's answer was lost in the clamor.
From all quarters arrived the accusing question:</p>

<p>"La Correction? La Correction?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was not at La Correction!" Javogues thundered
above the tumult. "There is no blood of
children on these arms."</p>

<p>"And of women?" Goursac caught up. "If
you say those arms have not been stained with
the blood of women, I tell you, you lie!"</p>

<p>Javogues snatched up his cutlass, but, changing
his tactics, appealed to the assembly:</p>

<p>"Hear me!"</p>

<p>From all sides they cried angrily:</p>

<p>"No! no!"</p>

<p>"I demand the right of speech."</p>

<p>"No! no!"</p>

<p>"Hear him!" Barabant cried from the tribune.
"Condemn no man without hearing him."</p>

<p>Nicole, with a swift premonition of an overhanging
vengeance, started to cry:</p>

<p>"No, Barabant, no!"</p>

<p>But Geneviève, entwining her arms about her,
besought her, crying:</p>

<p>"Mercy, Nicole, mercy! I love him!"</p>

<p>At points in the crowd others caught up Barabant's
cry, until, after five minutes of fury and
storm, the noise dwindled and went out.</p>

<p>Javogues, facing his accusers, returned his
weapon to his belt, spread his legs as though to
withstand the impending shock, folded his arms,
and ran his eye over the banks of his enemies.</p>

<p>"Citoyens, I have answered that I was not at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>La Correction. You ask me if on these arms
there is the blood of women. This is my answer:
I do not know!"</p>

<p>"He mocks us!"</p>

<p>"Insolent!"</p>

<p>"Liar!"</p>

<p>"Impostor!"</p>

<p>"This is the blood of traitors," Javogues cried
when the outburst had subsided, "and that is all
I know. Traitors have no sex. When I see a
traitor, I do not stop to ask if it be man, woman,
or child, old or young! A traitor is a traitor!
Were the mother who brought me forth or the
child of my flesh to conspire against the Nation,
I would strangle them with these my own
hands!"</p>

<p>Again the clamor rose to drown his words, but
this time Goursac, rushing from side to side,
shouted:</p>

<p>"Let him continue! Let him continue!"</p>

<p>"Of what I have done I am ready to give an
accounting," Javogues continued disdainfully.
"At the prison of Les Carmes, my hatchet sent
down to Hell the soul of that arch-conspirator
Dulan." He lifted his arms. "That is the blood
these arms bear, and I glory in it. At the Abbaye,
I myself purified the Nation of five traitors.
At La Force&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>But from the angry crowd rose the cry:</p>

<p>"Enough! Enough!"</p>

<p>One voice, deep and rumbling with an accent of
doom, made itself heard:</p>

<p>"We give the right of speech to a citoyen to
defend himself, not to a criminal to recite his
crimes!"</p>

<p>Goursac, mounting to the tribune, secured a lull.</p>

<p>"You have recited these executions," he cried,
addressing Javogues. "By what authority did
you constitute yourself a judge?"</p>

<p>Javogues, opening his arms, said:</p>

<p>"By the authority of popular justice."</p>

<p>"Where is your warrant?"</p>

<p>The Marseillais did not answer. The section,
seeing where he was being led, kept an intense
silence as Goursac's voice, rising in denunciation,
continued:</p>

<p>"You admit these deaths. You claim popular
authority. Show us your warrant from any
popular body, from any section, and you march
from here unmolested."</p>

<p>Javogues, turning to his companions, said in a
low tone: "Save yourselves. I remain." The
two moved&mdash;but forward to his side.</p>

<p>The eyes of the assembly were on Goursac,
who, white with the intensity of his passion,
slowly stretched forth his finger:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well?" He waited a moment, his figure
rigid in denunciation. "No answer? Then I
pronounce, before this assembly, that you have
lied! I here declare that what you have done is
not the work of a judge, but of a murderer! That
when you declared you acted by popular authority,
you slandered the Nation, and tried to fasten
on it the stain of your guilt and the odium of
massacre!" Then assembling all his powers, he
shouted at the top of his lungs, "Slanderer of the
Nation!"</p>

<p>He turned to the section.</p>

<p>"Citoyens, these are the vipers that assail every
life. No one of us is safe. They threaten the
Assembly. They do not conceal their desire for
its massacre. But to-night we hold one, this
monster, this scum of the earth. We hold him,
self-confessed and convicted. Citoyens, I declare
to you we shall be guilty of cowardice if we now
allow this monster to live another day!"</p>

<p>"Aye, to prison with them!"</p>

<p>"À la mort! À la mort!"</p>

<p>"À la guillotine!"</p>

<p>Above the confusion one shrill voice rose victorious,
bearing the final decree of the mass.</p>

<p>"No, citoyens! À la lanterne! À la lanterne!"</p>

<p>The next moment all other cries were swallowed
up in the wild outburst:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>
<p>"À la lanterne!"</p>

<p>A hundred hands were stretched out to grasp
the Marseillais, when Barabant, to the despair of
Nicole, flung himself in front of Javogues, and
with appealing arm sought to be heard. But the
torrent he faced was relentless. He saw nothing
but open mouths, clenched fists, black brows; pistol,
knife, and hatchet tossing above the surge of
arms. His friends thundered in his ear:</p>

<p>"À la lanterne!"</p>

<p>Those in the back, climbing on the benches,
bellowed down:</p>

<p>"À la lanterne!"</p>

<p>From the tribune, frenzied and terrible in his
anger, Goursac whipped on the tempest:</p>

<p>"À la lanterne!"</p>

<p>Barabant, with all effort of his lungs, could not
utter a sound against the storm. Those that
were near shouted to him:</p>

<p>"Barabant, do not balk us!"</p>

<p>"Barabant, look out for your own neck!"</p>

<p>All at once, through the crowd, the terrified
figure of Nicole struggled toward him. She
flung herself to his side, catching him violently
by the shoulders, panting and hysterical.</p>

<p>"Barabant&mdash;for my sake&mdash;Barabant&mdash;for
your own safety&mdash;Barabant&mdash;if you believe in
a woman's premonitions, do not save that viper!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>
<p>He shook his head and firmly but gently put
her from him. The girl, covering her face with
her hands, yielded to her despair and fell back
into the crowd; while Barabant, never flinching,
fought the uproar until he forced the frantic
audience to listen.</p>

<p>"This man," he cried at last, above the persisting
clamor&mdash;"this man is guilty; he should
die!" The uproar broke out afresh. "He has
put human beings to death without authority
from the people. He <i>must</i> die!"</p>

<p>"À la lanterne!"</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>"Shut the doors! Lock the doors!"</p>

<p>"But, citoyens," Barabant burst out, "neither
have we the right of death. Denounce him,
arrest him, but obey the law. Respect the law;
respect justice. Citoyens, I demand the arrestation."</p>

<p>The shouts rose in conflict.</p>

<p>"No! no!"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! yes!"</p>

<p>"Death to him!"</p>

<p>"Arrest him!"</p>

<p>"Hang him!"</p>

<p>"The law! The law!"</p>

<p>The mob was divided, threatening to clash
and annihilate itself. The result was a dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>times in doubt, but after half an hour of lull and
tumult the verdict was for the course of the law.
Barabant again mounted the tribune and put the
resolution of arrest.</p>

<p>Javogues and the two Marseillais were led
away; the storm rolled out; the hall emptied;
a few loiterers straggled down the benches, staring
at Nicole, who, exhausted, sobbed on the shoulder
of Goursac:</p>

<p>"What a mistake! What a mistake!"</p>

<p>Barabant, leaving the tribune, approached his
friends. Now that the passions of the moment
were cold, he began to doubt the wisdom of his
act.</p>

<p>"I could not help it, Nicole," he said, moved
by her utter grief. "It was right, Goursac, was
it not?"</p>

<p>Twice he repeated the question without success;
nor did the other answer until they reached
the Rue Maugout. Then, at length, his bitterness
broke through.</p>

<p>"Barabant," he cried, "I will say but one thing:
my life is on your head."</p>

<p>"That is absurd," protested Barabant. "Javogues
is in prison. He will be condemned."</p>

<p>"He will not remain there one hour!" Goursac
replied curtly; but conquering his dejection,
he extended his hand. "Barabant, I know you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>meant well&mdash;but you made a mistake. Remember
what I say!"</p>

<p>"Meaning I have betrayed you?"</p>

<p>Goursac made no answer.</p>

<p>Barabant, turning brusquely, repeated the
question:</p>

<p>"Citoyen, did I do wrong?"</p>

<p>"Barabant, my young friend," Goursac answered,
avoiding the question, "when I meet a
snake, I do not stop to ask if it is another's
property!"</p>

<p>"Then I was wrong?"</p>

<p>"If Javogues loses his neck and we keep ours,
no. If Javogues keeps his&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rubbed his own solicitously, it being unnecessary
to complete the sentence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By six o'clock the prophecy of Goursac was confirmed,
and the inhabitants of the Rue Maugout
learned, without astonishment, that Javogues had
been liberated and was in hiding.</p>

<h2>XV<br />
<small>LOVE, LIFE, AND DEATH</small></h2>



<p>From above there came the shrill, rebellious
cry of a woman. Below, in the court, the
tenants were gathered, seeking refuge from the
heat of the night. A few lights upon the sheer
walls and the faint glow of the descended moon
illuminated the dim groups: the men against the
wall, the women clustered in the center. The
cry was repeated, rising shriller. From the wall
the exclamations arose:</p>

<p>"It isn't gay!"</p>

<p>"Sangdieu, two in a week! There's no peace
left!"</p>

<p>"Eh, citoyen, if we're to fight all Europe, we
must have soldiers!"</p>

<p>A peddler, a transient from la Mère Corniche's
cellar, added in high tones:</p>

<p>"Thank God, just the same, we're men!"</p>

<p>The crones listened critically, without emotion,
resuming their old wives' tales when the cry had
ceased. Once a child, more keenly responsive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>to suffering, burst into a frightened whimper;
but the mother, with an exclamation of impatience,
sprang up and with a slap silenced the
child, crying:</p>

<p>"Little brat, who told you to do that!"</p>

<p>Under the torch that lighted the entrance to
the stairs the ghoulish figure of la Mère Corniche
hobbled forth, returning from her inspection.</p>

<p>"Well, what news?" a voice cried.</p>

<p>"Eh, it'll be all night now," she answered
peevishly. "I'm going to get some sleep."</p>

<p>The women, hearing this, broke up and departed
to their rooms; the men began to grumble:</p>

<p>"What the devil's to be done?"</p>

<p>"I'm for the cabaret."</p>

<p>"You can't stay here."</p>

<p>"There's no sleep to-night. Come on to the
cabaret."</p>

<p>"You'll join us, Citoyen Goursac?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm remaining here."</p>

<p>"And you, Citoyen Barabant?"</p>

<p>"I also."</p>

<p>"Morbleu, you've strange tastes!"</p>

<p>They shuffled away, leaving Barabant and
Goursac, with their backs to the maple-tree, in
possession of the empty darkness.</p>

<p>Presently lights began to splotch the walls, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>at the windows appeared the silhouettes of feminine
forms, while a running comment resounded:</p>

<p>"Where are the men?"</p>

<p>"Gone to the cabaret, probably."</p>

<p>"They are, if my man's among them."</p>

<p>"They're all weak-kneed."</p>

<p>"The cowards!"</p>

<p>The cry of the woman returned.</p>

<p>"Aïe, what lungs!"</p>

<p>"I yelled so, the police came up."</p>

<p>"You were right."</p>

<p>"Pardi!"</p>

<p>"Let's hope she'll give us some rest."</p>

<p>"Amen!"</p>

<p>The lights, one by one, flattened into the darkness.
A single window, under the eaves, continued
bright, from which ever descended the
cry of battle.</p>

<p>"Does that affect you?" Goursac asked, following
the momentary shadows across the panes.</p>

<p>"I don't like to hear it."</p>

<p>"You get accustomed to it, as to all things.
Tiens! I was forgetting. I heard to-day that
Dossonville had escaped."</p>

<p>"Absurd."</p>

<p>"They said he had been seen with Louison."</p>

<p>"But Nicole says she saw him cut to pieces."</p>

<p>"Then doubtless it was a mistake."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>"No news of Javogues?" Barabant took up.</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"That makes three days. You see, he's left
the city."</p>

<p>"I doubt it." Goursac added after a moment:
"I'll tell you something curious. You know
Geneviève?"</p>

<p>"That child who lives with Nicole?"</p>

<p>"She's in love with him."</p>

<p>"What! that little ogre?"</p>

<p>"Eh, the ogre has the spark of the woman in
her!" He jerked his head toward the lighted
window. "Who's with her?"</p>

<p>"Nicole and Geneviève."</p>

<p>"Much good it'll do them."</p>

<p>"Hanh?"</p>

<p>"Good night. I'm going to philosophize! Are
you staying?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Scarcely had Goursac departed before the
form of a young girl emerged from the stairs, and
Nicole's voice said softly:</p>

<p>"Barabant, are you there?"</p>

<p>"Here I am."</p>

<p>He sprang eagerly to meet her, but Nicole,
retreating before the decisive word, hastened to
say:</p>

<p>"Poor girl, it is not going well. Geneviève
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>is staying with her. Have you been waiting
long?"</p>

<p>"I? No. I was talking with Goursac. He
has just left." Barabant, determined to bring
matters to an issue, added relentlessly, "I was
just leaving for the cabaret."</p>

<p>"What! you were not waiting for me?"</p>

<p>"I could not count on your coming."</p>

<p>Nicole's eyes filled with tears, and, unable any
longer to bear the unequal contest, she cried
bitterly:</p>

<p>"Barabant, you are cruel!"</p>

<p>"I?" he answered, with a last effort. "I
who have offered you everything? I whom you
will not believe when I tell you I love you?"</p>

<p>"I do! I do!"</p>

<p>Barabant, no longer resisting her weakness,
cried:</p>

<p>"But I adore thee, Nicole. I am out of my
mind with love for thee!"</p>

<p>He seized her in his arms and kissed her on
the cheeks, on the forehead, on the wet eyelids,
with all the overpowering, reason-consuming
flame of love.</p>

<p>She withdrew from his grasp, and looking him
anxiously in the face, said:</p>

<p>"You thought me heartless and capricious,
didn't you?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have forgotten."</p>

<p>"But you did."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Ah, Barabant, it was because I loved thee
that I avoided thee."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>His face expressed so much bewilderment that
Nicole passed her hand gently over his eyes.</p>

<p>"No, that thou wilt never understand. If I
could only tell thee how I love thee!" She
wanted him to know the deep maternal longings
that he had stirred within her, but all she found
to say was, "I feared to love thee too much,
and so I fought against myself." Then, with
the first awakening of coquetry, she nestled on
his shoulder and said confidently, "Forgive
me."</p>

<p>"But why? Why?"</p>

<p>"It absorbed all that was in me, and I was
afraid."</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>She did not want to tell him of her doubts, so
she said:</p>

<p>"Women have foolish ideas, Barabant; you
must not try to understand them."</p>

<p>She joined her arms around his neck and laid
her head upon his shoulder. Suddenly the silence
was rent by the inexorable cry. In the heart of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>Nicole something penetrated like a knife. She
began to tremble.</p>

<p>"Why do you shake so?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is from joy."</p>

<p>"You love me so, then?"</p>

<p>When the silence returned, she said:</p>

<p>"Barabant, promise me but one thing."</p>

<p>"I promise it."</p>

<p>"When the day comes that you are leaving
me for another woman, tell me first." She added
low, as though she did not want him to hear:
"I can kill myself without seeing her in his
arms!"</p>

<p>Barabant, recoiling before such a picture of
the future, cried from the bottom of a heart of
pity:</p>

<p>"Never! Never!"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I could not leave thee, even so," she
said, weeping herself at the thought she had
conjured. "Let me always be thy servant. I
am only an ignorant girl, not fit to be thy companion.
Let me take care of thee, though, whatever
happens!"</p>

<p>"No, never that! Never! Nicole, it is for
life, forever!" he cried with the sincerity of the
moment, which is the sincerity of the lover. He
was young, generous, quick to pity, and he
adored her. "You do believe me?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>
<p>"Almost."</p>

<p>He redoubled his protestations, while Nicole,
laughing through her tears, cried gaily:</p>

<p>"Go on, Barabant. It is good to hear. Don't
stop&mdash;more, more!" At last she herself arrested
his protestations: "Yes, Barabant, I believe
thee. Oh, anything you can say to me I'll
believe at this moment!"</p>

<p>"That I want thee while I live?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Forever?"</p>

<p>"For&mdash;ever." She drew herself up to his lips.
"I have been so miserable waiting for thee."</p>

<p>Their lips met and they stood in the darkness
as one body, while above, unheeded, from the
darkness broke out the cry of life and death.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not leave me, Nicole, again, neither
now nor ever?"</p>

<p>"Do I not love thee?" she said simply.</p>

<p>They passed from the shadow and moved,
tightly enlaced, through the dim region of the
dwindling torch, slowly up the steep, hard steps
into the enveloping darkness beyond. Again
was lifted up the cry of anguish and rebellion,
the cry of Prometheus, heritage of woman, and
again came silence.</p>

<h2>I<br />
<small>FAMINE</small></h2>



<p>On the first day of September, 1793, Nicole
left the Rue Maugout with the intention
of visiting the Convention. Her step, that a year
ago would have been confounded with the hum of
life, now echoed down the quiet streets without
interruption. Her eye, that once flashed so
alertly through the curious crowd, passed with
the indifference of habit down the deserted vista,
and returned into the fixity of mental abstraction.
The passers-by were rare; those who hung on the
windows screened themselves. At a few doorways
groups of emaciated children watched her
progress, eyeing her basket with wolfish eyes. A
year had brought but slight change in her. She
still retained the bloom of youth, but her glance
was more pensive. She was no longer gipsy or
girl. A certain thoughtfulness had succeeded,
elusive and arch, that told of the awakened imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>Twice on her way a band of police enveloping
a prisoner passed, as passes a whirlwind
over the stretches of the desert. Nicole gave
them but a casual glance; such of the inhabitants
as the familiar fall of feet brought to the windows
retired indifferently, the prisoners themselves
stoically adding their resignation to the
monotony of the scene.</p>

<p>On the thoroughfares knots of Tapedures, the
ruffians of the Terror, became frequent, stalking the
town, beating the streets for their human game.
Occasionally she met a bill-poster affixing the latest
decree of the Republic&mdash;violent notes, in blue,
violet, yellow, or red, that splashed the walls on
every side. About the bakeries and butcher-shops
knots of beggars were assembled, often reclining
on the ground, watching with dreary, troubled
glances those havens of food, ready to battle for a
scrap of refuse.</p>

<p>A mother from a distant quarter, drifting from
shop to shop, halted before such a group with a
timid inquiry. From the loiterers, watching with
confident indifference, a hag, extending her shriveled
arm, shouted sarcastically:</p>

<p>"Welcome, citoyenne. You want something
to eat? Take it; take it. We are so tired of eating
meat in this section&mdash;nothing but beef and
mutton and venison and pheasants here, morning
and night. We get tired of that sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>thing in the end, you know. You were right
to come here; see how well fed we are, how
sleek! Don't believe him, his cellars are full of
meat. It's rotting away. No one to eat it!"</p>

<p>From the fasting hags a rumble, rather than a
laugh, went up. The woman who had covered
perhaps half of Paris melted into a storm of
sobs, beseeching a crust or a bone for the sake of
her children. Then the hag, her raillery changing
to anger, burst out:</p>

<p>"And we, have we no children? Are we not
mothers, too? Hark to the woman: she thinks
she's the only one to be pitied! Be off! Leave
us in peace with your eternal wailings!"</p>

<p>At other times, women from the quarter itself,
returning from a scouring of the markets, would
awaken a sudden flame of interest.</p>

<p>"What luck?"</p>

<p>"What did you get?"</p>

<p>"Bread?"</p>

<p>"Meat?"</p>

<p>The scouts always denied success. Then a
chorus arose:</p>

<p>"She's hiding it!"</p>

<p>"Show us your basket!"</p>

<p>"Eh, and under your dress!"</p>

<p>Once, in the Rue St. Honoré, a slip of a girl
had almost freed herself of the questioning crowd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>when a lean dog with a sharp nose bounded,
sniffing, to her side. There was a quick turning
in the crowd, and the nearest woman, leaping to
her feet, shouted hysterically:</p>

<p>"I smell dried fish!"</p>

<p>The next moment, up the street a scuttling
speck fled before a frenzied cloud from which
shot out white arms and grasping hands.</p>

<p>Through such mad scenes of famine, Nicole
arrived at the Hall of the Convention; where,
being early, she entered the Tuileries to await the
arrival of Barabant.</p>

<p>The gardens that once resounded with the hum
of life, that once were gay with the swish of many
colors, were now brown with the uninterrupted
stretch of earth, rustling with the pervading sigh
of leaves. Already in the trees, in the air, and in
the tired soil was the melancholy of the parting
season. Each breath that disturbed the branches,
however slightly, set free a caravansary of fluttering
leaves, and the leaves were sear.</p>

<p>She seated herself on a bench and abandoning
the basket and clasping her knee, watched the
whirling leaves heap themselves about her feet.
One or two poised on her shoulder, in her hair,
without her heeding them. Presently Goursac,
also on his way to the Convention, joined her.</p>

<p>"This is the work of the cursed Montagne!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>he said grimly, viewing the desolate gardens.
"And yet Javogues is not satisfied. He would
turn it into a cemetery!"</p>

<p>"Listen, my friend," she said earnestly. "If
the Girondins fall, you will not stay to sacrifice
your life to Javogues?"</p>

<p>"Do you think that I, a Girondin, would fly
from that rascal!" he cried indignantly. "He
works in the dark; he is incapable of striking in
the open."</p>

<p>"And if the Girondins fall?" she persisted.
But he refused to entertain the suggestion.</p>

<p>"This reminds me," he said, with a sweep of
his arm, "of the time we were here a year ago.
Do you remember?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," he said brusquely, "are you happy?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"As happy as you thought?"</p>

<p>"No," she said slowly, "but it is my fault.
The fault of my position, if you wish. I am
jealous!"</p>

<p>"Of Louison?"</p>

<p>"No! Of what may happen."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he marry you?" he said
angrily.</p>

<p>"Because I have not asked him," she answered
wearily. "And because I would not have it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I love him, my friend," she said in
rebuke. "And because a waif of the streets does
not marry a man of education and position unless
she wishes to drag him down."</p>

<p>Goursac, to her surprise, leaned over and
patted her hand; then, as though ashamed to
have shown such tenderness, he added gruffly:</p>

<p>"That is the only thing that can make you
happy."</p>

<p>She did not deny it.</p>

<p>"I know what you have passed through."</p>

<p>She shook her head incredulously.</p>

<p>"It is but the history of womankind," he said
laconically.</p>

<p>She took a leaf that had fallen on her hair and
tore it slowly to shreds.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, warming to the subject,
"you but resume in a year what woman has
struggled for throughout the centuries. What
is marriage but the instinct of self-preservation?
Who imagined the bond? The weaker being,
woman; and all the advances up the social scale
have resulted from her silent striving toward
equality with man. Without marriage you are
a slave at the mercy of an angry word or a
hostile mood; a slave who, in her search for
security, must learn, without tears or show of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>fatigue, to render herself indispensable to the
man."</p>

<p>Nicole rose abruptly, frowning, and with nervous
fingers; but immediately she reseated herself
with a forced laugh.</p>

<p>Presently, seeing that he had said more than
he should have, he withdrew, leaving her immersed
in the reverie his words had awakened.</p>

<p>Goursac had guessed truly. What womankind
has endured, she had begun from the bottom.
The instinct of self-preservation within her had
awakened the immense intuitions that in the
silent, enduring conflict of the sexes alike direct
the wife, the mistress, and the outcast. She
had studied Barabant, seeking the needs of
his temperament, discovering his faults, and leading
him to gradual dependence on her. Her
imagination awoke. She saw the peril of mere
domestic companionship. Where at first she had
belittled the force of passionate love, she had
come to realize its necessity and the need of
constantly provoking his curiosity. She hid her
thoughts from him, making of herself a mystery,
employing that coquetry which, to the seeing
eye, has at the bottom nothing but pathos. She
had loved as a child. She had become an actress.</p>

<p>But in her heart of jealousy and doubt she
knew well all her artifices could avail no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>than her youth. In marriage alone was peace
and security. The daring of the thought frightened
her. She knew it to be beyond her lot, nor in
her devotion to Barabant would she have it so,
but each day the dream returned, as from a pit
one sees a star, or from a wreck the beacon on
the forbidden shore.</p>

<p>Barabant found her lost in reverie, the leaves
again unnoticed on her shoulders.</p>

<p>"The effect is pretty," he said, smiling down
at her.</p>

<p>"On whom the leaves fall and rest, the earth
will fall before the year is out," Nicole said.
"That's the superstition."</p>

<p>"Nicole, I forbid you to say such things," he
cried sharply. "They hurt me, and you know
it!"</p>

<p>Satisfied with this evidence of his affection, she
sprang up, brushing away the leaves, and saying
with a smile:</p>

<p>"There, they have no power now."</p>

<p>"You are early."</p>

<p>"Yes; I was a little melancholy; I wanted to
reflect. The gardens are delightful for that."</p>

<p>"I do not find them so."</p>

<p>"The mood is gone, now that you are here."
She took his arm, smiling up into his face. They
strolled through the alleys of chestnut and maple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>Nicole drawing her skirt across her, placing her
feet daintily, shaking her head in pretended anger
as from time to time a leaf fluttered against her
cheek.</p>

<p>"And the Girondins, mon ami? You have
told me nothing of them."</p>

<p>"It grows worse and worse for them. The
Jacobins are relentless."</p>

<p>"Don't identify yourself too much with them,
then."</p>

<p>"But that is cowardice."</p>

<p>"No. If the Girondins fall, all the more will
the Nation need the Moderates," Nicole answered
anxiously, for her one dread was of his impulsive
nature. "Why play into the hands of our enemies?"</p>

<p>Leaving the gardens, they entered the Place
de la Revolution. The vast square that had
swarmed with the multitude on the day of the
execution of the king was devoid of movement,
except where a few curious, wandering toward the
emplacement of the absent guillotine, streaked
like insects across the placid expanse.</p>

<p>Nearing the plaster statue of Liberty, Nicole
was attracted by the lank figure of a man.</p>

<p>"Look over there," she said, drawing Barabant's
attention. "Wouldn't you say that it
was Dossonville?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<p>"There's a little resemblance."</p>

<p>"Much."</p>

<p>Barabant, who continued to study the figure,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Really, the resemblance is striking!"</p>

<p>At this moment the man, turning, disclosed indeed
the familiar features, while the well-known
voice cried:</p>

<p>"Mordieu! It is Nicole and my little orator
Barabant! Well, what's the matter? Touch
hands!"</p>

<p>For Nicole, with a movement of superstition,
had crossed herself, while Barabant, stock-still, remained
staring stupidly at the apparition, until
he was able to blurt out:</p>

<p>"What, it is you! Then you're not dead."</p>

<p>"Not even once!" he cried, slapping his hand
emphatically across his chest. "I give you my
word, it is not true! Come, feel of me. Is this the
arm or the chest of a specter?"</p>

<p>"Still, I saw you," exclaimed Nicole, unable to
reconcile the fact to her memory&mdash;"I saw you
at the gate of the Abbaye&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear girl," Dossonville responded, with
much good humor, "believe me, I am not dead;
and, what's more, I never have been dead that I
remember."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<p>"Mordieu, Nicole! are you determined to exterminate
me?" Dossonville cried. "Let us
reason. You saw me at the gate, but you didn't
see me cut down, did you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I reject your theory."</p>

<p>The three burst out laughing, until Dossonville
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But come, Louison must have told you."</p>

<p>"Louison!" echoed Barabant and Nicole,
more and more amazed.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary woman! She can even keep a
secret then!" Dossonville cried. "Why, it was
Louison who found me in the crowd and piloted
me to safety."</p>

<p>He recounted shortly the events of his escape,
adding, as he extended his arm in a sweeping embrace
of the horizon:</p>

<p>"And here I have lain concealed. I don't say
where; the secret is too good. For ten months I
lay like a rat. For the last two I have gone out
only after midnight. To-day is the first trip into
the blessed sun."</p>

<p>"Do you dare to risk it even now?" Barabant
cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, now. Everything is arranged," he answered
carelessly. "It was a little long coming,
but it came."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>
<p>But suddenly Nicole, remembering, exclaimed:
"Barabant, you must warn him that Javogues is
back."</p>

<p>"Back!" Dossonville repeated. "When did
he leave?"</p>

<p>Barabant, in his turn, recounted the arrest and
disappearance of the Marseillais, concluding:</p>

<p>"He reappeared with the rise of the Terrorists."</p>

<p>"Aïe, aïe!" Dossonville cried, having followed
the recital with interest; "I cannot say that
the situation is pleasant for the Citoyen Goursac."</p>

<p>A shadow passed over the brow of the young
man, and he answered bitterly:</p>

<p>"I was a fool. We should have crushed the
monster when we had him."</p>

<p>"There's good in him."</p>

<p>"What! You say it?"</p>

<p>"He wanted to cut my throat," Dossonville
replied; "but that's nothing. He is sincere.
It is true, from his point of view, there are not
three men who should be alive in France to-day;
but that is only a prejudice. I am keeping you;
where are you bound?"</p>

<p>"To the Convention."</p>

<p>"Always a Girondin?"</p>

<p>"Well," Barabant answered doubtfully, "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>Girondins had their chance, and they could not
control the Convention."</p>

<p>"I say it's their own fault if they fall," Nicole
interjected hastily.</p>

<p>"Nicole, you are right," Dossonville replied.
"Moreover, they are about to lose their heads."
He drew his finger across his neck. "In a political
party, that's a grave failing."</p>

<p>"What, guillotine the Girondins!" Barabant
exclaimed. "Guillotine Vergniaud, Brissot,&mdash;they
would never dare!"</p>

<p>"Bah! you look upon it too seriously," Dossonville
retorted. "What is the guillotine? Simply
a vote of censure. But Louison&mdash;where can
I find her?"</p>

<p>"At the Prêtre Pendu," Nicole answered.
"You'll find her there about noon. That is, if
there is no execution this afternoon."</p>

<p>"The Prêtre Pendu? Don't know it."</p>

<p>"It opened lately in the Rue Maugout, opposite
No. 38."</p>

<p>"You call it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Prêtre Pendu."</p>

<p>"Charming!"</p>

<p>"I warn you, Javogues will be there."</p>

<p>"You are positive?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Good. Then I'll set out at once."</p>

<h2>II<br />
<small>DOSSONVILLE EARNS A KISS</small></h2>



<p>Dossonville, taking the river bank, proceeded
with many inquiring halts, inhaling
the air and sunshine in full breaths. He strolled
into the halles, where the stalls, in state of siege,
extended in long, deserted barracks; no buying,
no selling, no provisions, only in the shadows the
same clusters of limp basking beggars, slumbering
with one ear alert.</p>

<p>As he languidly pursued his way, a door at
his side was flung violently open and a man
bearing on his back an enormous side of beef
scurried across the place toward a butcher-shop,
the door of which swung open to receive him.
Instantly, with a hue and cry from every corner,
there was a swift leaping of famished men,
women, and children. Before Dossonville could
leap aside he was caught in the rush, elbowed,
buffeted, and thrown off his feet. When again
he rose, the butcher was buried under a mound of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>ravenous humanity, thirty feet from his destination,
while the square was obscured with the multitude
that battled over the shreds of meat which
came up from the bottom of the heap.</p>

<p>Hardly had he extricated himself from the
tangle when, in the Place de la Bastille, a group
of savage boys, pursuing a dog with a bone, swept
by him, snatching at the fleeing animal, unmindful
of its anger. One hand at last, more
fortunate than the others, closed over the brute,
and the human children tore the bone from the
beast. Pursuing now a haggard boy, they returned
in a cloud, panting, with famine-inflamed
eyes, while the lean, infuriated brute at their
heels struck with angry jaws into the pack.</p>

<p>Beset on every side by troops of children too
weak to extend their hands, Dossonville arrived
at the Rue Maugout, readily recognizing the
Cabaret of the Prêtre Pendu by its figure of a
priest, which, swinging from a miniature gibbet,
advertised the republican principles of the host.</p>

<p>Seeing no one before the entrance of No. 38,
he penetrated into the inner room of the cabaret,
where, the two or three groups occupied with
cards being unknown to him, he exchanged salutations
with the hostess, asking genially:</p>

<p>"Your husband, citoyenne, I hope, is frying
me a bit of steak?"</p>

<p>"My man's with the army."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>
<p>"A patriot, then."</p>

<p>"And there's no meat."</p>

<p>"An omelet will do."</p>

<p>"No eggs, no fish, no vegetables."</p>

<p>"Diable! that leaves nothing but bread and
cheese."</p>

<p>"No bread, no cheese!"</p>

<p>"Mordieu, what am I going to lunch on?"</p>

<p>"Soup."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Dossonville nodded, with understanding.
"True! As long as the material world
exists, soup is possible. Well, soup be it, citoyenne,
soon and hot."</p>

<p>He passed curiously to the card-players, for
his ear had caught such strange expressions as
these:</p>

<p>"I play the Liberty of Marriage."</p>

<p>"I the Genius of Peace."</p>

<p>"The Equality of Rank."</p>

<p>"Liberty of the Press."</p>

<p>"Taken by the Genius of Arts."</p>

<p>Dossonville, much perplexed, moved to a survey
of the pack. He found the Monarchs indeed
dethroned; the Kings succeeded by the
Geniuses of War, Commerce, Peace, and the
Arts; the Queens replaced by the Liberties of
Faith, Professions, Marriage, and the Press. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>Knaves themselves, as though suspected of royalistic
tendencies, had yielded to the Equalities
of Duties, Color, Rights, and Rank.</p>

<p>"The sentiment is perfect," he murmured to
himself, "perfect, but perplexing."</p>

<p>The hostess appearing with a capacious bowl,
he returned to his corner, where he contemplated
the soup with that respect and curiosity which a
Parisian gives to a dish of which he has not had
the making. He stirred it doubtfully, and at
the first taste drew a long face.</p>

<p>"Tonnerre de Dieu! They've put the aristocrats
in the soup," he grumbled. "However,
being good patriots, we must eat it."</p>

<p>He was bending over the bowl, when a shadow
darkened the open doorway, and with the fragrant
scent of flowers came the voice of Louison,
chanting:</p>

<p>"Cockades, patriots; cockades, my Sans-Culottes.
The last ones I have been able to save
for you."</p>

<p>She passed among them, calling to them by
name, tapping them on the shoulders, but receiving
nothing but banter.</p>

<p>"Are they good to eat&mdash;your cockades?"</p>

<p>"As a salad, nothing is better." Taking up
the idea, she repeated laughingly: "Buy my
salads, citoyens; buy my patriotic salads!"</p>

<p>Wishing to enjoy her surprise, Dossonville
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>kept silent, leaning forward, his chin in his
palm, smiling expectantly. Thus Louison discovered
him. The very slightest look of astonishment
passed over her face, a fugitive amazement
that she immediately controlled.</p>

<p>"Louison, you are discretion itself," Dossonville
said approvingly, his smile extending to a
grin as he stretched forth his hand. "If ever
the Revolution places women in power (and
what is impossible to-day?), I'll recommend
you for Minister of Foreign Affairs."</p>

<p>"Citoyen, citoyen, you are mad to enter this
place," Louison cried. "Do you not know that
this is the headquarters of Javogues?"</p>

<p>"I know it; but see you, Louison, that animal
is so stupid."</p>

<p>Divining that despite his careless manner he
was fortified against the encounter, she relaxed
and said more calmly:</p>

<p>"Really, I didn't expect that you'd escape."</p>

<p>"My dear Louison, it is not so difficult."</p>

<p>"In these days it is."</p>

<p>"A man has as many lives as a cat," he said
ironically. "It is the imagination that is lacking."</p>

<p>As though to put this theory to the test, a
voice jarred upon the stillness, crying:</p>

<p>"Where is the spy?"</p>

<p>The next instant the cabaret was thrown into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>turmoil as Javogues, at the head of three or four
companions, rushed in.</p>

<p>"Good day, citoyen," Dossonville's cool voice
was heard saying above the uproar, "and how
goes it with you since we parted last?"</p>

<p>Guided by his voice, Javogues precipitated
himself toward his enemy, but as his hand shot
forth it stopped in mid-air, and he fell back in
astonishment.</p>

<p>Dossonville, never losing his poise, with an
imperceptible movement of his hand had rolled
back the lapel of his redingote, disclosing on his
breast the shield of an agent de sûreté.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Javogues exclaimed, recoiling.
"You an agent de sûreté! It's a counterfeit!"</p>

<p>Dossonville checked the second rush as coolly
as the first. His hand went into his breast
pocket and withdrew a document, which he tendered
to Javogues on the tips of his fingers, saying:</p>

<p>"Read, and grow wise."</p>

<p>The Marseillais passed it to a companion,
who shook his head and passed it to a third, who
read in a piping voice:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Office of the Committee of Safety</span><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Citoyen Santerre having appeared before us and established
the alibi of the Citoyen Dossonville on the day of the
Tenth of August, we declare the Citoyen Dossonville innocent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>of all suspicion. Furthermore, as it appears he refused to disclose
the nature of the secret mission, in the interests of the Nation, on
which he was engaged, even at the risk of his life, we declare the
Citoyen Dossonville a patriot who deserves the gratitude of his
country.</p>

<p>We further appoint the said Citoyen Dossonville agent de
sûreté, with the following powers&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>"The rest is quite technical," Dossonville interrupted.
He turned to Javogues, who, thus
robbed of his dearest vengeance, remained transfixed
with stupor. "You see, Citoyen Javogues,
you cannot always tell a traitor by the look in
his eyes."</p>

<p>Stung by the taunt, Javogues advanced furiously:</p>

<p>"It's a lie," he cried. "It's another of his
tricks. The paper is a forgery." Then turning
to his companions, he shouted: "Don't let him
out of your sight until I return!"</p>

<p>Dossonville, erect and solemn, checked him
sternly:</p>

<p>"Enough! Enough, citoyen, do you hear?
What you have done I forgive&mdash;but go no
further! An act such as you contemplate is a
defiance of the Nation. I represent the Nation.
Citoyen Javogues, I warn you, at the next attack
you make against me I'll have you on the
scaffold within twenty-four hours."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<p>Javogues, impressed despite himself, found no
encouragement in the faces of his comrades. He
turned on his heel and went dejectedly toward
the door. There he wheeled, and shaking his
fist, cried:</p>

<p>"Dossonville, if I am not to hate you, arrest
me, guillotine me at once. For, as long as I
live, it is war between you and me! If you
want me, you'll find me here, at five."</p>

<p>Dossonville remained a moment pensive and
erect.</p>

<p>"Mordieu!" he exclaimed at last, "the fellow
is genuine. Devil take me if I can help liking
him." Then turning to Louison, who had followed
him with fascinated eyes, he said: "As
for you, ma belle, I owe you everything. To
begin with, I swear an eternal love."</p>

<p>And, taking her in his arms, he kissed her on
the cheek, and then sat down.</p>

<p>In a moment the room was swept of its terrified
guests, while the proprietress, disappearing
through a back door, left the memory of a red
stocking.</p>

<p>Louison, at the familiarity, recoiled, while
anger like a blast from an oven inflamed her
face. Her hand stole to her bosom, and with a
sudden movement she hid a knife behind her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>Dossonville, feigning ignorance, appeared engrossed
in the selection of a cockade from the
abandoned basket. But as the girl in her passion
leaped at him, he sprang aside, whipped
out his sword, and flung himself behind a table.</p>

<p>Then, those without, flattening their noses
against the window or peering through the doorway,
beheld a furious combat between them; the
man, always cool and alert, checking the rushes of
the girl with the point of his sword, turning, retreating,
or advancing as his assailant, with the
rapidity of a bird, flew from point to point, darting,
feinting, or striking for an opening. Meanwhile
above the scuffle and the patter of feet the
voice of Dossonville rose imperturbably in running
comment:</p>

<p>"Hoop-là, parried! A little more to the left
and you had me. Mordieu, who'd have thought
a pretty woman would resent a kiss? Such a
fraternal kiss, too, so full of gratitude! Perhaps
that's the trouble; you never can tell with a
woman. What now?"</p>

<p>Bounding on the table, the girl without a
pause leaped full at him.</p>

<p>"Bravo! That's a jump for you. What a
woman! Louison, you are splendid. Dame, what
fury! À toi!"</p>

<p>Hard pressed with the recklessness of her attacks,
he threatened her throat so closely that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>with the slightest stiffening of his arm, he would
have run her through.</p>

<p>"A life for a life! there's gratitude for you!"</p>

<p>From outside they cried to him offers of help.</p>

<p>"Never; any man that interferes, I'll shoot
down. This little affair is between us,&mdash;eh,
Louison? What now?"</p>

<p>He sprang away, barely avoiding a chair hurled
to break down his guard.</p>

<p>"That was well imagined. Mille diables,
what a woman&mdash;and not a sound! Louison, I
adore you already. Louison, my dear, do you
believe in another life? If you would only
guarantee me another, I'd give you this out of
courtesy,&mdash;only then I couldn't adore you.
What energy! If you are getting tired, Louison,
rest a while."</p>

<p>But her answer was to fling herself again at
him, seeking to come inside his guard by stooping
suddenly to one side, grasping at his blade
with her free hand. Dossonville, forced to meet
the fury of the onslaught, a second time presented
the point of his blade to her throat; but this
time, so impetuous was her rush that only the
instant withdrawal of the weapon saved her.</p>

<p>"A second time, Louison, I spare you. My
gratitude, you see, is eternal. Louison, you fight
too recklessly, you expose yourself. You rely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>too much on my sense of gratitude. Hoop-là!
Again I had you! If it's only a matter of a
kiss that stands between us, you might give it
back to me. Ha, ha! Well struck, Louison!
Where will it end? My gratitude restrains me,
and you must realize what a good fellow you are
trying to end&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly, to the astonishment of all, Dossonville
included, Louison halted, panting and heaving,
restored the knife to her bosom, and burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>"Dossonville," she cried, flinging out her hand
in acclamation, "you're a man!"</p>

<p>He dropped on both knees, exclaiming: "That
word disarms me. Do me the favor of cutting
my neck."</p>

<p>With a movement as swift as her attack, the
girl passed to his side, and, bending suddenly,
kissed him on the forehead.</p>

<p>"That one, Dossonville," she cried, "you have
deserved."</p>

<p>And with a laugh, she flitted into the street,
where the spectators, respecting her sudden
whims, prudently left her an open passage.</p>

<h2>III<br />
<small>WAITING FOR BREAD</small></h2>



<p>In this season of famine, when the supply of
bread barely sufficed to feed one half of the
population, by six o'clock in the evening long
lines began to form in front of the bakeries, to
await through the long night the morning distribution
of loaves. Javogues, who took the
occasion of this assembling to study the crowd
for signs of traitors or faint-hearted republicans,
returned each evening, toward five o'clock, to
the Prêtre Pendu in a gale of patriotic ferocity.</p>

<p>But this afternoon, to the astonishment of those
who were accustomed to quail before his glance,
his lagging step, his knotted club trailing at his
heels, and his head relaxed on his shoulders gave
every appearance of dejection. At the Prêtre
Pendu he sank gratefully into a chair, covered
the table with his arms, and plunged moodily
into his thoughts.</p>

<p>Presently, arm in arm, bristling with weapons,
in villainous shoes wound about with strips of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>rags, appeared three Tapedures,&mdash;Cramoisin the
mountebank, Boudgoust the waiter, and Jambony
the crier,&mdash;thrown together by the strange
tides of the Terror. In the middle, Boudgoust
strode with hang-dog head, as though his height
had overshot his strength. The shriveled, furtive
mountebank clung to one arm, while at the
other waddled the bloated, leering cub of the
gutters. So tightly huddled were they that they
seemed one unclean body with three heads&mdash;an
incongruous union of malignant age, stultified
manhood, and vicious, insolent youth.</p>

<p>Perceiving Javogues silent and absorbed, they
slackened their pace, and Boudgoust said cautiously:</p>

<p>"Cramoisin, he's still in bad humor."</p>

<p>"It's that cursed Dossonville, my little Boudgoust.
If it worries him, why doesn't he get rid
of him?"</p>

<p>"Javogues's the devil when aroused," Boudgoust
continued apprehensively. He turned to
the boy: "Jambony, throttle that voice of a
carriage-crier and speak softly. It might be best
to slip away."</p>

<p>But Javogues, lifting his head, beckoned
them.</p>

<p>"Well, watch-dogs, what luck?"</p>

<p>Cramoisin and Jambony looked to Boudgoust,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>who turned his pockets inside out, showed the
flat of his palms, and answered:</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"An unfortunate day&mdash;for all of us," Javogues
said gloomily, and relapsed into bitter
reflections on his encounter with Dossonville.</p>

<p>"What luck!" exclaimed Cramoisin. "We
escaped easily. Suppose we eat something."</p>

<p>Jambony opened his mouth, and the voice,
trained to rise above the jargon of the street,
resounded from one end of the street to the
other.</p>

<p>"Food!"</p>

<p>The invariable bowl of soup and a bottle of
thin wine were placed in front of each. Boudgoust,
whose appetite was in proportion to his
length, accomplished his portion in one swallow,
and being thus reduced to philosophizing, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"All citoyens should be made to eat together."</p>

<p>"Nothing new there," Cramoisin interjected
querulously. "We have the Fraternal dinners,
haven't we?"</p>

<p>"That amounts to nothing," Boudgoust retorted.
He leaned his elbows on the table,
scratching the back of his hands as he talked:
"But every day, every meal. That's democracy!
Or, better, no citoyen to eat more than another!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>If I saw any one eating meat to-night I'd arrest
him. All citoyens should share alike."</p>

<p>Jambony, having now emptied his bowl, declared
in his stentor's voice:</p>

<p>"And I am for equality of dress. No distinction
between citoyens on account of dress! A
national costume&mdash;one for the men and one for
the women!"</p>

<p>Presently, while he launched into the details
of his scheme, a raven, with a croak and a flap
of its wings, hopped from the gloom of the opposite
entrance, followed by the diminutive figure
of la Mère Corniche, who, giving a nod of understanding
to the four, installed herself on a stool
and began to knit.</p>

<p>"There's one who's no Girondin," Boudgoust
grunted.</p>

<p>"She's a tiger since the death of Marat,"
Jambony remarked in a thundering whisper.
"She was very devoted. They say&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he proceeded to detail one of those fantastic
tales which the Parisian playfully attributed
to any woman, were she eighty or eighteen.</p>

<p>Cramoisin, having caressed the last drop in his
bowl, now exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Jambony, you are tiresome, you and your
national costume. You go half-way. What we
must restore is the primeval innocence!" As he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>spoke he pressed a flat thumb on the table, while
from under his eyebrows shot the shrewd dagger
glances of the madman. "The primeval innocence&mdash;there
only is the truth! Nothing but
that can restore republican simplicity. No clothes
at all! A return to the simplicity of Adam and
Eve&mdash;the true, the real republicans! There's
something that would be sublime!"</p>

<p>"Allons, Cramoisin, you have too much vanity!"
Boudgoust replied.</p>

<p>"Yes, he wants to display his beauty," put
in Jambony, who retained the spirit of raillery
gathered at the doors of the theater. "We know
that trick, old fellow."</p>

<p>Cramoisin was beginning a furious answer when
Javogues, turning impatiently, demanded the
hour.</p>

<p>"Close to seven."</p>

<p>"They come later every night," Javogues
grumbled. He rang the table with his fist. "Perhaps
they think they can hide their guilty faces
in the dusk!"</p>

<p>Presently, from the entrances, people with baskets
began to appear, directing their way toward
the Bakery Gobin, a rod below, to take up the
vigil that consumed the night.</p>

<p>Those who passed the Prêtre Pendu waited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>anxiously their welcome from the mouth of Javogues,
whose salutations varied according to his
estimate of their patriotism.</p>

<p>"Greetings, patriots."</p>

<p>"Greetings, citoyens."</p>

<p>"Greetings."</p>

<p>To some he simply nodded in return. Occasionally
he stiffened and, without recognition,
fastened his scrutiny on the eyes of a new arrival,
as though to tear away the mask and wrench
forth the secret.</p>

<p>Marching purposely toward them, looking
Javogues disdainfully in countenance, came
Goursac. So implacable were the glances the two
enemies exchanged that they seemed to clash
midway in the air. Arrived within ten feet of
the group, Goursac turned curtly on his heel and
departed toward the bakery without having recognized
them by word or nod. The Tapedures
cursed; Javogues, following him with his glance,
muttered:</p>

<p>"Sacré! Girondin, wait a little longer!"</p>

<p>Several women passed, among them Nicole,
who received a friendly greeting from Javogues,
Boudgoust commenting:</p>

<p>"Fine woman that, Cramoisin, for all you
say!"</p>

<p>Cramoisin scowled for an answer, following the
girl with a glance of implacable hatred.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>"Eh, yes," Jambony added, sinking his voice.
"As for me, if it weren't for Javogues I'd not
keep her long chained up to that cursed Barabant."</p>

<p>"Barabant," growled Boudgoust, "is an indulgent.
He is forever talking of mercy."</p>

<p>"He who speaks of mercy in these days," cried
Cramoisin, purposely raising his voice, "is in
league with aristocrats. He should be denounced."</p>

<p>Javogues turned angrily:</p>

<p>"Enough! Barabant is a patriot. I know it!"</p>

<p>Boudgoust, who disliked quarrels, interrupted:</p>

<p>"Hello, who's this brat?"</p>

<p>A girl of six or seven was approaching, carrying
in her arms a stool.</p>

<p>Javogues, at once suspicious, stopped her.</p>

<p>"Who sent you out, my little one?"</p>

<p>"Papa."</p>

<p>"And who is your father?"</p>

<p>"The wig-maker there," she said, showing the
shop with her small finger. "He's coming to
take my place later."</p>

<p>"Ah, your papa is a good Royalist."</p>

<p>The child, frightened by his looks, remained
twisting from side to side, while Javogues, softening
his voice, repeated the question.</p>

<p>The child shook her head.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>
<p>"What does he say of us?" It was Boudgoust
who put the question.</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>"But he suffers much with this famine, doesn't
he?" suggested Cramoisin, slyly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered, the innocent face
brightening. "Papa says we suffer more now than
before."</p>

<p>Cramoisin, triumphant and smiling, drew back;
the child toddled on.</p>

<p>"Ah, Citoyen Flaquet," Javogues cried in
triumph, "who doesn't dare pass us in the daylight
and who regrets the royalty, we hold you
at last!"</p>

<p>Among the next to leave No. 38 was a girl of
sixteen, who, in greeting Javogues, faltered a
little in her walk. It was Geneviève, suddenly
blossomed into a woman. Her eyes, that formerly
were too black and large on her sallow
face, were now in fair relief to her cheeks, that
had flushed with the glow of womanhood. She
moved lightly, and even the carelessness of her
dress could not conceal the full figure, erect and
flexible. The four men watched her pass on
and take her place in the lengthening line.</p>

<p>"The best of the lot!" Cramoisin said.</p>

<p>"She was ugly enough last year," Boudgoust
replied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>
<p>"She was not a woman then," retorted the
other, who seized the opportunity to broach his
favorite theory. "Women, they're good enough
in their places. They're put here to give men
to the world. I believe in the community of
women. No marriage. Women discriminate
according to a man's being old or ugly or poor.
All discrimination is unrepublican. There
should be no distinctions."</p>

<p>"Yes, my old fellow, but halt there," Jambony
said impudently. "No community of men."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You'd fall to the lot of la Mère Corniche."</p>

<p>Cramoisin angrily resented the interruption.
He passed to the sociological aspect of the reform,
and declared that with the Nation battling
against all Europe such a measure was needed
to fill in the gaps of war. Other bottles were
brought and torches.</p>

<p>Below at the bakery, two torches disclosed the
undulations of the monstrous queue, but the
faces and the outlines of the figures were confounded
in the night. Sometimes a brief song
would mount up, a few whispered communications
could be heard, and the steady snoring of a
sleeper.</p>

<p>From there, in the narrow circle of light under
the figure of the priest, which swung in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>grotesque outlines, the four Tapedures could be
seen, drinking and discussing. At times their
voices, impassioned and drunken, reached the
line, the high pitch of Cramoisin crying:
"Primeval innocence! community of women!"
or the bellow of Javogues, "There is no God!"
as the four, without listening to one another,
debated furiously their sublime ideas.</p>

<p>From time to time others arrived through the
darkness, relieving those in line. Toward midnight
Barabant replaced Nicole. Several of the
new arrivals were fresh from cabarets; many of
those whom no one relieved began in drunken
boisterousness to scream upon the night ribald
songs and jests, foul anathemas of the party in
disfavor.</p>

<p>The noise of kisses and tipsy laughter became
frequent. The women and children, accustomed
to the scene, retired under shawls and sought to
efface themselves against the chilly walls. Some
women, more vicious than their mates, joined in
the drunken carnival, which toward three o'clock,
when the torches dropped back into the night,
knew no bounds. And all the while, amid this
licentiousness, muffled or in brazen outcry, the
line asleep or cringing, whispering or ribald,
waited stolidly for the dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after three, Javogues and his body-guard
quitted the cabaret to make the rounds. A
single torch held aloft by Boudgoust lit up the
huddled queue. They passed down the line, Jambony
and Cramoisin embracing the women, Javogues
compelling all to cry "Vive la Nation!"
and "A bas les Indulgents!" As luck would have
it, Cramoisin perceived the face of Geneviève,
which, in her curiosity, she momentarily displayed.</p>

<p>The drunkard flung himself forward and seized
her in his arms. She defended herself furiously,
averting her face, resisting all his efforts to drag
her into the street; until Cramoisin, getting his
arm around her waist, wrenched her forth screaming
in her terror:</p>

<p>"Citoyen Javogues, Citoyen Javogues, protect
me! Don't let him take me, Citoyen Javogues!"</p>

<p>Javogues, recognizing the voice, ran up.</p>

<p>"Who've you got there?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see I've got a woman?" Cramoisin
said surlily. He added an obscenity that
caused the girl, in despair, to exclaim:</p>

<p>"Oh, Citoyen Javogues, save me, save me!"</p>

<p>"None of that," Javogues cried angrily. "Let
her go."</p>

<p>As the drunken Cramoisin started to protest,
with a blow of his fist he knocked him down.
Geneviève, carried down in the fall, flung herself
at the feet of Javogues, grasping his knees.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>
<p>"Thanks, thanks," she cried hysterically.
"Citoyen, you are good, you are kind!"</p>

<p>Then fearing to become too prominent, she
hurried to her place, enveloping her head with
a shawl and crouching back into the friendly
obscurity.</p>

<p>Cramoisin, whimpering, disappeared; Javogues,
Boudgoust, and Jambony reeled away.
Fatigue stilled even the noisiest. The night was
achieved in sleep.</p>

<p>Toward six the line roused itself, as two inspectors
of the municipality arrived to preside
over the distribution of the bread. The doors
were opened and the frantic rush began, those in
the rear crowding forward with frenzied inquiries,
which changed into the familiar shrieks of
despair when the doors were closed with a third
of the line unserved.</p>

<p>Geneviève, who had received her maximum of
bread among the last, avoided the outstretched
hands of the unsuccessful and escaped up the
street, to where la Mère Corniche, at her post,
exacted a tithe from each lodger. Dropping her
tribute in the basket, she was hastening on when
the concierge retained her with the cry:</p>

<p>"The Citoyen Javogues wants you."</p>

<p>Thinking that it was to fetch water from the
Seine, the girl sought her bucket and hastened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>to the room of the Marseillais. At the sight of
the bucket, Javogues frowned and asked:</p>

<p>"What are you doing with that?"</p>

<p>"Don't you want me to fetch water?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ah."</p>

<p>"Leave the bucket in the corner."</p>

<p>Geneviève obeyed. Javogues shut the door,
returned, and frowned again as he saw that she
was trembling.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" he said roughly.
"Why do you tremble?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of me?" he said, advancing.</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>"Then what is it?"</p>

<p>"I'm glad&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"True?"</p>

<p>All at once the girl, flinging herself at his feet,
caught his hands and cried:</p>

<p>"I love you, I love you, I love you!"</p>

<p>"What, me!" Javogues cried, amazed, retreating
a step. "You love <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"I adore you. I think of nothing but you.
You are my god!"</p>

<p>"There is no God!"</p>

<p>"Yes, when one loves."</p>

<p>"Then you love me&mdash;it's true?" he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>raising her to her feet. "Why do you love
me?"</p>

<p>"Why?" She drew a long breath. "You
are so big, so heroic!"</p>

<p>Javogues fell back into a chair, repeating:</p>

<p>"Extraordinary! I don't understand."</p>

<p>She threw herself into his arms with the movement
of a child, and, without seeking to conceal
her thoughts, repeated a hundred caresses while
he continued to mumble stupidly:</p>

<p>"Extraordinary! Extraordinary!"</p>

<p>Finally her emotion penetrated him. He took
her in his hands and held her from him, she coloring
with pleasure at this show of force, which
came to her as a caress.</p>

<p>Suddenly a tremor ran through his immense
body, an upheaval out of which came something
gentle and softened. He continued to hold her
before him, without shifting the glance that
plunged into her eyes, while the girl, turning in
his grasp, repeated, "Let me go!" for, child that
she was, she divined what was passing in him.</p>

<p>"But why," he repeated stupidly&mdash;"why do
you love me? I don't understand. No other
woman ever has."</p>

<p>"Because you are so heroic. All the others
understand nothing of poverty and sorrow. You&mdash;you
understand. You give hope to such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>I. When I hear you speak those sublime
thoughts, my heart swells. You too have suffered;
you know the abyss." She added, not
without elation: "I loved you from the first day.
I never thought you'd notice me."</p>

<p>"It's true&mdash;really true, then&mdash;what you say
to me?"</p>

<p>For all answer she looked at him and smiled.</p>

<p>"It's curious. I don't understand it," he said
at last. "But I believe I'm beginning to love
you."</p>

<p>Then, without quite knowing why, she lowered
her eyes.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>



<h2>IV<br />
<small>SIMON LAJOIE</small></h2>




<p>The inhabitants of the Rue Maugout, astounded
by the sight of Geneviève arm
in arm with the overshadowing Javogues, had
not recovered from the shock of this evidence of
human feeling in their tyrant when the next day
brought them a further surprise.</p>

<p>Toward five in the afternoon Dossonville, with
the evident purpose of impressing his enemies by
a new accession of strength, made his appearance,
with a body-guard of two. The onlookers, enjoying
the amazement of the Marseillais, were
yet themselves astonished and perplexed at the
incongruity of the new reinforcement.</p>

<p>One, short and contracted, gave the impression
that by some mysterious settling his head had
shrunk on his shoulders, his shoulders had moved
toward his waist, and by this gradual process his
whole body had been telescoped into his legs. A
huge, flattened nose, or rather beak, imposed itself
upon the yellowish, parched face and empty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>cheeks, while from two slits under the overhanging
brows, the half-hidden eyes, without deviating
from their forward direction, absorbed the
outer world.</p>

<p>His companion, in contrast to the dragging
gait of his fellow, moved in short steps, picking
up his feet. The sharp nose, set as close as is
possible to the perpendicular, pointed the way to
the head, which, set forward on the craning neck,
seemed in turn to be running ahead of the frail
body.</p>

<p>Dossonville, with his loose amble and important
tilt of head, gave the cabaret a "Salut!" and
continued twirling in his hand for his only
weapon an ivory baton a scant two feet in length.
Behind him the watch-dogs paused, one grim,
taciturn, and furtive, the other loquacious, florid
of gesture, and loud, while, as a cur at the approach
of a strange dog draws himself up snarling
and apprehensive, Javogues and the three
half started from their chairs.</p>

<p>Satisfied with the discomfiture of the Terrorists,
Dossonville led his followers to the Place de la Revolution,
where he found the execution over and
the crowd, with a scattering hand-clap, dispersing.</p>

<p>On the terraces of the Tuileries a few spectators
still lingered curiously, looking down on the
scaffold that violently interrupted the peaceful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>vista of the woods beyond. Threading his way
through the widening network of women, soldiers,
spies, muscadins, and laborers, Dossonville
perceived Louison, who, having at last quitted
the environment of the scaffold, was returning
toward the Cabaret de la Guillotine to dispose of
her cockades.</p>

<p>"Well, Louison," he cried, "you have a bored
air! It was stupid this afternoon, then? The
show did not interest?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a priest to-day&mdash;all priests die
in the same way," she answered. "However,
yesterday it was better. They guillotined twin
brothers. That was something out of the ordinary."
She added thoughtfully: "It's curious
how alike men are on the scaffold."</p>

<p>All at once she perceived the two who had
halted obediently at a distance of twenty paces.
Dossonville, when her glance had traveled from
them to him, and back and forth, in amazement
and inquiry, opened his wide mouth and said
with pride, indicating them with a flourish:</p>

<p>"Aren't they darlings, though? My assistants,
my lambs, my watch-dogs!"</p>

<p>Louison, seized with a sudden, mad laughter,
found a moment to say:</p>

<p>"Where, please, did you find such a pair of
cutthroats?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>
<p>"From the galleys."</p>

<p>"And you trust them?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I'd trust an honest man?"
Dossonville exclaimed, with a laugh that left the
girl in doubt as to his seriousness. "What is
an honest man? A man who has not been sufficiently
tempted. Give me the rogue every
time. Depend on no man until he is a rogue&mdash;a
rogue you hold, by his past. With an honest
man you are at the mercy of his future."
He again designated his assistants. "A word
from me would send them to the guillotine.
That is the only way to insure tranquillity."</p>

<p>"That's a new theory," Louison exclaimed,
much amused. "And there is sense in it.
What do you call them, your trusty rogues?"</p>

<p>"You see the short one with the borrowed
legs?" Dossonville answered proudly. "I call
him Le Corbeau, from his beak and blinking
eyes. I picked him up in the Cour des Miracles,
ex-beggar, ex-cripple, ex-thief, hidden in a
cellar. I offered him protection from arrest in
return for services. He accepted; I supplied a
coat and a hat, and there he is.</p>

<p>"The other who stands there shaking in the
wind is Sans-Chagrin, ex-priest, recanted and
reformed. On the subject of our bargain I say
nothing, only that I dispose of his neck as easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>as mine." Dismissing them by a signal, he
took Louison's arm. "Now for us. What do
you say to a drop of something in the Rue de
Bourgogne?"</p>

<p>"I say, on to the Rue de Bourgogne!"</p>

<p>At the scaffold they made a detour to escape
the contact of blood, which made the place
abhorrent and carried on the shoes of those who
passed in front of the scaffold the red trail for
blocks about.</p>

<p>Louison, as they went, was crying her cockades,
when suddenly they were aware of a shrinking
and a widening in the crowd, and looking up,
perceived Sanson, the executioner, and his sons
advancing, impassive to all demonstrations.
Seized with a mad desire, the girl stepped
toward them, crying:</p>

<p>"A cockade, Citoyen Sanson, a red cockade!"</p>

<p>The next moment Dossonville had jerked her
away.</p>

<p>"Mordieu, Louison!" he cried angrily. "Why
did you do that?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" she said, laughing. "The
Revolution has abolished prejudices!"</p>

<p>"It cannot change human nature," he retorted.
"You can call him Executor of Public Judgments,
Avenger of the Nation, he is always the
executioner." He added frankly, "Louison, ma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>belle, there are really moments when you are
not human. At an execution you are like
granite!"</p>

<p>"Very well, do not notice me."</p>

<p>"That's easy to say," he grumbled. "Besides,
I'm curious."</p>

<p>"Indeed."</p>

<p>"Barabant has been telling me about that extraordinary
mother of yours."</p>

<p>"Barabant?" Louison said uneasily. "He
doesn't like me."</p>

<p>"I like nothing so well as a mystery," Dossonville
continued enthusiastically. "I have
three plans already to make her speak."</p>

<p>"Five would do no good."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"She has left for the provinces."</p>

<p>"Diable!"</p>

<p>"Besides, I do not care to be mysterious,"
she said impatiently, "and I do not like to be
thought strange."</p>

<p>"Speak no more of it," said Dossonville,
though inwardly relinquishing nothing of his
purpose. "In future I'll consider you only as a
commonplace woman."</p>

<p>Louison regarded him maliciously.</p>

<p>"Determine that for yourself."</p>

<p>"Satané de femme!" he exclaimed. "I'll be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>very careful what I determine. Louison, you
are not a woman who can be loved comfortably.
I tell it to you frankly. The place seems good;
let us sit down."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several nights later, Dossonville, resting on his
rounds, was seated at a table in front of the
Café de Valmy, in the Quartier des Bonnes
Nouvelles. The bells had announced the midnight;
from the intersections of the square the
streets yawned to him out of the impenetrable
darkness.</p>

<p>For once Dossonville abandoned himself to
reverie&mdash;a mood evoked by the memory of Louison.
Since his encounter, the mystery of her
birth had continually teased his imagination.
The terror of la Mère Baudrier when Louison
had announced the discovery of her father, and
again the mother's strange rendezvous in the
Square de la Bastille, suggested such an unusual
solution, without offering a clue, that his mind
returned again and again to the problem.</p>

<p>In another corner, Sans-Chagrin, late in his
cups, disputed with the host upon the value of
religion, while Le Corbeau, who by his silence
gained the majority of the decanter, pretended
indifference to the discussion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know what I say," Sans-Chagrin was declaiming.
"Religion is a farce and the Assembly
will do well to abolish it!"</p>

<p>"That is not so certain," objected the listener.</p>

<p>"It will come."</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Religion will be abolished! I know what
I'm saying. I was a priest myself."</p>

<p>"Come, now!"</p>

<p>"True. They expelled me. And why? Why?
Tell me that."</p>

<p>"Out with it."</p>

<p>"For instituting reforms. Religion is a farce!"</p>

<p>A woman, scenting a story, issued from the
door, and leaning on the shoulder of her husband,
said:</p>

<p>"Come, Citoyen Sans-Chagrin, tell us of that."</p>

<p>"I reformed the confessional," Sans-Chagrin
began querulously. "Aye, and it needed it, too.
Every day and every hour I had to be disturbed
for a confession. I said to myself, if there's so
much wickedness, it's because the confessional
isn't rigid enough. That's logical, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"And what did you do?"</p>

<p>"Only this. I announced that, in future, to
avert confusion and to better impress the penitent
with his crime, I would hear confessions thus:</p>

<p>"On Monday, all the liars.</p>

<p>"On Tuesday, all the misers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>
<p>"On Wednesday, all the slanderers.</p>

<p>"On Thursday, all the thieves.</p>

<p>"On Friday, all the libertines.</p>

<p>"On Saturday, all women who lead bad lives."</p>

<p>His listeners burst out laughing, while the
woman said, "And no one came?"</p>

<p>"No one came!" Sans-Chagrin repeated indignantly.
"No one came! And the Church, instead
of adopting the reform, expelled me. They
said I wanted to be rid of confessions. What a
farce, my friends, what a mockery!" He spread
out his arms in appeal to their judgment, slapped
his chest three times, and fell back loosely in his
chair, exclaiming, "Oh, oh, oh!"</p>

<p>Dossonville, who had lent a moment's amused
attention to this farcical recital, rose and returned
to the march, a man&oelig;uver which caused Sans-Chagrin
and Le Corbeau to choke in their haste
to empty the decanter.</p>

<p>They had gone but a short distance when
Dossonville's ear caught the slight rasp of a window
opening overhead. Flattening himself against
the wall, he covered his lantern with his cloak,
with a whispered caution to his followers as the
window continued to give forth its low complaint.
There was a minute's silence, and then it was
drawn shut, and the slight click of a bolt was
heard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>Hearing nothing further, Dossonville finally
resumed his walk, but at the next corner some
one muffled in a cloak fell into his arms.</p>

<p>The man, with a dozen pardons, sought to
make a detour, but Dossonville's long arm, shooting
out, grasped his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, citoyen. There's a little formality
we must not forget. Name and errand?"</p>

<p>The stranger, perceiving him neither to be
surrounded with pistols and knives nor to have a
very threatening air, answered:</p>

<p>"Citoyen Clappier, Section des Bonnes Nouvelles.
I am hurrying to seek a doctor."</p>

<p>"Show your card of citizenship, and pass."</p>

<p>"The devil!" the man exclaimed, after a show
of searching in his pockets. "I forgot to take it
out of the coat I wore this morning."</p>

<p>"Really, citoyen, you are in bad luck," Dossonville
replied. "I shall be forced to accompany
you." He summoned Sans-Chagrin and
Le Corbeau out of the shadow, and gave him
into their charge, with a "Lead the way!" Then
he dropped behind, murmuring, "Provided one
does not enter that doctor's by the window."</p>

<p>They journeyed silently for several minutes,
until suddenly the three ahead halted, and Sans-Chagrin,
returning, said:</p>

<p>"The citoyen wishes to speak with you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<p>Dossonville, who had expected this dénouement,
had the prisoner brought to him.</p>

<p>"Well, citoyen, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Citoyen, I ask a moment's private conversation."</p>

<p>"With me?"</p>

<p>"With you alone."</p>

<p>"It is important, then?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>Perceiving that their walk had brought them
near to their starting-point, Dossonville led the
way to the Café de Valmy, passing through
which, he entered a small room, giving orders to
his body-guard to remain without. Then shutting
the door, he straddled a chair, rested his arms on
the back, and with a smile awaited the opening.</p>

<p>"Citoyen Dossonville&mdash;" the man began.</p>

<p>"What! You know me?"</p>

<p>"For a long time."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Dossonville exclaimed, astounded
and nonplussed by this knowledge.</p>

<p>"Citoyen Dossonville," the man continued, "I
ask of you one promise. If I convince you of
my patriotism and my citizenship, will you guard
my secret? I ask you as a man of honor."</p>

<p>Dossonville inclined his head.</p>

<p>"Agreed. I promise to keep the secret, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>condition that you convince me of your patriotism&mdash;that
is, by showing me your true card of
citizenship."</p>

<p>"That will not be necessary."</p>

<p>Throwing back his cloak, he removed a wig
and mustaches, discovering to Dossonville the
features of Sanson, the executioner.</p>

<p>"Do you recognize me?"</p>

<p>At this sinister figure, Dossonville recoiled
with a movement beyond his control, but recovering,
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Pardon."</p>

<p>"It is nothing," Sanson answered flatly. "I
am used to it."</p>

<p>"Pardon. What surprises me is this," said
Dossonville, hiding his own emotion. "That
you who have been imprisoned for suspected
Royalist interests should expose yourself to suspicion
for any cause."</p>

<p>"Have you not guessed my errand?" Sanson
said, with a frown.</p>

<p>"Until you disclosed your identity, yes,"
Dossonville retorted sharply. "But such adventures
do not necessitate a disguise at one o'clock
in the night. Citoyen Sanson, had I met you
otherwise, I should have nothing to say; but
disguised and under a false name is different. I
shall have to report it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>
<p>Sanson reseated himself.</p>

<p>"For thirty years I have assumed disguises
and another name. Do you need to be told the
reason? You yourself gave it but a moment
ago,"&mdash;he paused,&mdash;"when you recoiled."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," Dossonville said coldly,
resolved to push him to the end. "Explain fully.
If I am to risk myself thus, I must know all."</p>

<p>"What you cannot understand&mdash;you cannot
understand!" Sanson broke out irritably, while
his eyes sought the face of his captor, doubting
the sincerity of the objection. The movement
of anger passed; recognizing the peril of his
position, he extended his hand and began in a
flat, monotonous voice:</p>

<p>"Citoyen Dossonville, it is disagreeable, but I
cannot make conditions. Citoyen, I need not
tell you that we have always lived apart from
society. As far back as we know, every male
of our family, from father to son, has been of the
same profession. All others are barred to us.
Three have tried to bury themselves in the
outer world. They were driven back. Every
woman has married an executioner, every man a
daughter of one. The office I hold was given
Charles Sanson in the year 1688. My grandfather,
my father, and myself have inherited it.
It will descend from son to son, whether King or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>Republic succeeds. Nothing will ever change
that!"</p>

<p>He paused a moment in distaste before continuing:</p>

<p>"When we appear in public, a space is opened
to us. We pass in any crowd without touching
a shoulder. The poor, to whom we give alms,
recoil before our touch. The woman who would
speak to us would be cast out, as a pariah. But
no woman, recognizing us, would wish to speak
to us. We had hoped the Revolution would
free us from the universal prejudice&mdash;vain hope!"
Then, as though he had said enough, he broke
off acridly: "And yet you cannot understand
why I disguise myself?"</p>

<p>Dossonville, lost in the strange vista which the
recital had opened to his imagination, did not at
once reply.</p>

<p>"And you keep the secret from every one?"
he asked at last.</p>

<p>Sanson, perceiving the question was one of
personal curiosity, replied curtly:</p>

<p>"I have said that no woman knowing us has
ever spoken to us. I should have said, except
one." He smiled, if the curling of his lips could
be called a smile. "A bouquetière who was
with you one day on the Place de la Revolution."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>
<p>"The story is on your word alone," Dossonville
said, irritated by this allusion. "It lacks
evidence."</p>

<p>"Then you do not remember me?" Sanson
said.</p>

<p>Dossonville, startled at the turn, for a moment
lost his self-possession as he strove to penetrate
the allusion.</p>

<p>"Citoyen Dossonville, can you recall the Café
Procopé about twenty years ago, and a certain
Simon Lajoie who sometimes played a game of
checkers with you in the evening, and who inspired
you with a great deal of curiosity?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," Dossonville replied, staring at him
in perplexity.</p>

<p>"Do you remember that his visits ceased the
day your interest prompted you to follow him
from the café?"</p>

<p>"What!" Dossonville cried, rising, and extending
his hand in question. "It was&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It was I."</p>

<p>"Tonnerre de Dieu!"</p>

<p>And falling back, he stared in empty, stupid
amazement.</p>

<p>"Are you convinced?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"I hold your promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<p>Sanson readjusted his disguise, while Dossonville
sought some pretext to retain him and make
him talk.</p>

<p>"Citoyen, one question."</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"I should like to know," Dossonville said,
"does the popular hatred affect you?"</p>

<p>Sanson frowned, hesitated, and then answered
in two words eloquent with meaning:</p>

<p>"Not now."</p>

<p>Then, without offering his hand, he turned,
saying peremptorily:</p>

<p>"Adieu!"</p>

<p>Sans-Chagrin and Le Corbeau, who would not
have allowed the devil himself to pass without
an order, brought him back. Then Dossonville,
springing to his feet, cried:</p>

<p>"Set the Citoyen Clappier free! The Citoyen
Clappier is an industrious patriot!"</p>

<h2>V<br />
<small>CRAMOISIN PLOTS AGAINST NICOLE</small></h2>




<p>Cramoisin, since the day of his humiliation
before Geneviève, had vented his
spite on Barabant, seeking thus his vengeance
on Nicole. Several times, in measure as the
trial of the Girondins neared its end and it
became evident that their condemnation was
inevitable, he had sounded Javogues on the
score of Barabant, only to be repulsed with decided
negatives. But each defeat, by feeding
fuel to his hatred, only increased his determination.
Convinced, at length, that nothing could
be accomplished for the present through Javogues,
he had recourse to la Mère Corniche,
hoping to find in her an ally.</p>

<p>The shrewd little woman was not long in
perceiving his intention. So having sufficiently
enjoyed his timid skirmishes, she summoned him
to her early one morning, after the distribution
of bread, and said point-blank:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>
<p>"Out with it. What do you want to say to
me?"</p>

<p>The face of Cramoisin artfully showed surprise.</p>

<p>"Come, old fellow, let us understand each
other. You hate Barabant, eh?"</p>

<p>"Barabant is a Girondin," Cramoisin ventured,
and then, deceived by her mood, he
plunged on: "He is a Moderate, a contre-Révolutionnaire.
He is against Robespierre and the
Jacobins."</p>

<p>"Not a bit," la Mère Corniche interrupted,
having now entrapped him. "He is a follower
of the great Marat!"</p>

<p>"Who are you telling that to!" Cramoisin
cried contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Hark, old fellow, no airs with me," the
concierge retorted sharply. "The Citoyen Barabant
came here with a letter to Marat. I saw it.
As for you, I know what you're after, my fine
patriot,&mdash;your eyes are on the girl!"</p>

<p>Cramoisin, now thoroughly alarmed, sought
only to retreat.</p>

<p>"Never in the world," he cried indignantly.
"Come, mother, you mustn't wrong a fellow-patriot.
I bear no hatred to Barabant. I thought
him a Girondin; he is always with that cursed
Goursac. But if you say he's not, I'm glad to
hear it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oui dà, of course you are! You look it,"
she retorted scornfully. "Come, get out of my
way; leave me in peace, old hypocrite. You
don't fool me an instant. Be off!"</p>

<p>Cramoisin escaped to the cabaret; la Mère
Corniche, mumbling to herself, settled back in
her chair; as the distribution of bread ended, the
lodgers issued forth with buckets, to get water
from the Seine. Resolved to put Barabant on
his guard, she had stopped him, when, to her delight,
she perceived Cramoisin disappearing into
the cabaret in such pitiful fright that she made
a pretext and allowed Barabant to depart, resolved
to prolong for a few days the agony of
the terrified bully.</p>

<p>She began the round of inspection which, at
the expense of her strength, she never failed to
accomplish each morning. She passed through
the empty rooms, scenting and prying, fumbling
among papers and garments, viewing one room
with a glance, ransacking another for the taint of
aristocracy or the earmarks of a traitor.</p>

<p>Arrived on Barabant's landing, she made a
satisfied, careless survey of the room, entering to
rest from her labors. On a chair, in a state of
mending, was the blue redingote the young fellow
had worn on his arrival. More from habit
than from suspicion, she ran her fingers through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>the pockets, and drew out the paper they encountered.
It was the envelop addressed to
Jean Paul Marat.</p>

<p>She regarded it stupidly, contracting her
brows, seeking an explanation, before, with a cry,
she tore it open. A sheet, empty and white,
slipped to the floor. La Mère Corniche, overcome
by the evidence of the duplicity, fell back
against the wall.</p>

<p>It was five minutes before she could realize
how she had been duped. Then from the miser,
and the devotee of Marat, a long howl of rage
broke forth, and clutching the letter, she fell from
the landing, rather than descended the stairs,
gained her room, and abandoned herself to the
transports of her rage.</p>

<p>A half-hour later she hobbled forth, white but
controlled, to the entrance, where, perceiving
Cramoisin, she cried with a furious gesture:</p>

<p>"Come here."</p>

<p>At this angry summons the Terrorist would
have slunk away had not la Mère Corniche cut
off his escape, crying:</p>

<p>"Cramoisin, idiot, imbecile, come here!"</p>

<p>She seized him, trembling at her tone, and
impelled him into the entrance, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"You hate Barabant? Answer me, you hate
him!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>
<p>"I swear&mdash;" he began, when she cut him
short: "Fool, I despise him! Do you hear
me? I despise him!"</p>

<p>While Cramoisin remained, with gaping
mouth, incapable of words, the old woman
poured out her reviling. At last he asked, in
amazement:</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"I want your help to destroy him."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you say so at first?"</p>

<p>Fearing to be forced into explanations, she
abated her fury and more calmly demanded:</p>

<p>"You have a plan; what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's true?" Cramoisin said, still unconvinced.
"You'll join me?"</p>

<p>"I swear it."</p>

<p>"We can't convince Javogues," Cramoisin
began, "unless we can make Nicole betray
him."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"Jealousy."</p>

<p>"Jealousy? Is there cause? Do you know
anything?"</p>

<p>"What is necessary we can invent."</p>

<p>"She won't believe it."</p>

<p>"She'll believe it when she hears it from three
persons," Cramoisin said, ruffling up his nose
and sneering. "A woman'll believe anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>three persons tell her. With Boudgoust and
Jambony, we are four."</p>

<p>"Is that your plan?" she cried, in disappointment.
"It's stupid, impossible!"</p>

<p>Cramoisin continued to argue with her its
merits; she accorded it a grunt, then a shake of
the head, and finally said:</p>

<p>"Well, yes; it may do. We can try."</p>

<p>"It's agreed, then. We must excite her
suspicions,&mdash;but nothing definite."</p>

<p>"What, are you going to give me instructions!"
la Mère Corniche cried irately. "As
though I couldn't handle a woman!"</p>

<p>"Touch hands, then; it's agreed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You must speak the first word," he said hurriedly.
"It will be better." Shutting off a
reply, he departed, leaving the concierge scowling
and angry.</p>

<p>"Oui dà, I'll speak the first word, old schemer.
He doesn't want the woman to lay it to him,
the toad!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning, as Nicole was leaving for
the flower-market, la Mère Corniche called to
her.</p>

<p>"Eh, Nicole, stop a moment." The girl, who
feared her, approached reluctantly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>
<p>"You're going to the market?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To-morrow is Sunday. I want to put some
flowers on the tomb of Marat. See what is going
cheap this morning and tell me."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"You must stop from time to time to give
me news," continued la Mère Corniche, taking
her hand.</p>

<p>"You know as much as I do."</p>

<p>"You sell flowers every day?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Your man doesn't earn enough, then?"</p>

<p>"With the price of food where it is one can't
earn too much."</p>

<p>"You are happy?" the old woman asked
brusquely.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask that?" Nicole replied,
resenting the question.</p>

<p>"There, don't get angry. You may have
friends you don't know of." She released her
hand, adding: "If you suspect nothing, I'll say
no more."</p>

<p>Penetrating readily the stratagem, Nicole
laughed over the encounter, and, perceiving the
bald attempt to rouse her jealousy, she dismissed
the conversation contemptuously from her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward midday, however, the insinuation returned,
and forgetting her first attitude, she suffered
a little at the very shadow of what her
imagination could conjure up. She ended by
again laughing at her simplicity, nor did her
mind recur again to the thought during the day.</p>

<p>That evening, as she passed in front of the
Prêtre Pendu, she encountered Cramoisin, who
watched her from the corners of his eyes, rubbing
his splayed thumb over his lip in such an ironical
fashion that she stopped and demanded
impatiently:</p>

<p>"Well, what is it? I seem to amuse you."</p>

<p>"Eh, perhaps you do."</p>

<p>"Come, what do you mean by such looks!"</p>

<p>Then rising, he looked her a moment in
countenance, and replied:</p>

<p>"Nicole, they told me you were clever."</p>

<p>"Well, what does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means that you are either very stupid,"
he said curtly, "or very blind."</p>

<p>Nicole mounted the steps in perplexity, arresting
her journey at every landing to ask herself
anxiously what he could have meant. In
her room she remained blankly at the window,
forgetting the meal she had to prepare. Several
times she passed her hand across her forehead, as
though to rout the unquiet thoughts, but always
returned to the same reverie. The church bell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>ringing five aroused her, and, ashamed to have
yielded to such doubts, she said angrily:</p>

<p>"Come, I'm an idiot! I'll tell the whole
affair to Barabant when he returns and we will
laugh at it together."</p>

<p>Yet when he entered, her resolution forgotten,
she rose quickly, and taking him by the arms,
looked anxiously in his face.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?" he asked.
"Why do you look at me so curiously?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid you would do something
rash," she said evasively. "What&mdash;what of the
Girondins?"</p>

<p>"It is hopeless. To-morrow they may be
condemned." But only half satisfied, he returned
to the question. "Was that all you wanted to
know? You looked at me very queerly."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," she said quickly. "Ah,
Barabant, I am so afraid that you will compromise
yourself with them."</p>

<p>"I must decide&mdash;and you would not have me
a coward, Nicole?"</p>

<p>She defended her position, she repeated the
old arguments, she tried to win him from the
thought of sacrifice; but of what had happened
during the day she said not a word.</p>

<p>"It is getting late," she exclaimed finally. "I
must get into line."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p>"Let me take the whole night," he pleaded;
"you are tired."</p>

<p>"No, no. Not at all."</p>

<p>She hurried below, furious at herself for having
betrayed to him her unrest, but when she
remembered how instantly he had noticed the
strangeness of her look, she could not help thinking
that a little suspicious.</p>

<p>The next morning she prepared to meet the
concierge with a new defiance, but la Mère
Corniche did not even raise her head. Cramoisin,
to her relief, was absent; only Boudgoust and
Jambony were lounging in front of the cabaret.
She cast a furtive glance in their direction; they
were laughing boisterously.</p>

<p>"They are laughing at me," she thought, all
her doubts returning.</p>

<p>She passed a miserable morning, tortured by
the fears that now seemed always to have been
with her. Unable to bear the tumult within her
breast, she determined to recount all to Barabant.
If anything existed, she must know it
definitely.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the arrival of Dossonville, who
joined them at lunch on the boulevards, prevented
the confidence, and during the meal another
suggestion added to her suffering. Barabant,
in speaking of Dossonville's interest in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>Louison, expressed his astonishment at the attraction,
ending peremptorily:</p>

<p>"As for me,&mdash;she repels me."</p>

<p>He had put considerable warmth into his
criticism; that and the simple declaration of
antagonism made havoc in the imagination of
Nicole. She thought the opinion obviously unnecessary.
She asked herself if he really were
interested in Louison, whom she had always
feared, would he not have said exactly what he
had. But from logical inquiry she soon flew to
conjecture and supposition, to weighing each
word and action and seeking a hidden meaning.
She thought no longer of confiding in Barabant,
but held herself on her guard.</p>

<p>She was not convinced&mdash;she but half believed;
yet she returned sadly. Her dream was over.
Whatever might come, the first breath of jealousy
had entered her heart, and, rightly or
wrongly, she knew that her tranquillity had departed
forever.</p>

<p>The Place de la Revolution was choked
with the multitude come to witness the
end of the Girondins. The populace, indifferent
to the sight of two or three executions a day,
gathered with common impulse to witness these
men, long lifted above their heads, go down to
their death in humiliation and disgrace. Many
who hungered, cursed them in the need of some
object to their hatred; others who feared them,
in the savage joy of deliverance; but the mass
hooted simply from the delight of seeing them
fallen.</p>

<p>Toward one o'clock the procession of five
carts, announced by all the tumults of the
human voice, cut through the frenzied hordes,
who from time to time fell back into silence,
astonished at the demeanor of these men; who
to insults addressed the crowds with cries of
"Vive la République!" or joined in the chorus
of the "Marseillaise."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p>The rumor had circulated that the body of
Valazé, who had committed suicide the night
before, was to be guillotined with the rest. In
the last cart, indeed, the people discovered the
corpse stretched among the living.</p>

<p>Arrived at the scaffold, the twenty descended;
the one remained. A jailer, to win a laugh,
propped up the corpse, crying:</p>

<p>"Hurry up&mdash;Valazé's waiting for you."</p>

<p>The crowd applauded with jeers and taunts.
The Girondins meanwhile ranged themselves at
the foot of the scaffold. When their number
was complete, with one movement they embraced.</p>

<p>Several, turning toward the public, lifted up
their arms and repeated the cry:</p>

<p>"Vive la République!"</p>

<p>Then, drawn up one against the other, giving
front to the torrent of their enemies, forgetting
even their individualities in the supreme moment,
the condemned began the hymn of the Republic:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Allons, enfants de la Patrie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Le jour de gloire est arrivé."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Every two minutes one of the fraternity left
the ranks and ascended the ladder; but the
chorus continued, uninterrupted either by the
wild acclaim that greeted the appearance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>each victim on the scaffold, or by the thundering
shout that told of the severed head.</p>

<p>The chorus thinned to three, to two, to one.
The last, without ceasing the chant, mounted to
the platform; only the knife interrupted the song.</p>

<p>Then, as far as the eye could travel, over the
immense square, over the packed bridges and
distant, darkened streets, like an immense flight
of released birds there appeared above the
crowd the red flutter of agitated liberty-caps.
The populace, who believed that from out this
hecatomb would come relief from famine, bread
and meat to save them, shouted frantically.
They also shouted who feared to be silent. The
uproar continued for ten minutes before the
mass disintegrated.</p>

<p>As Goursac, with heavy heart yielding to the
impulse of the crowd, sought his friends, from
whom he had separated for the sake of prudence,
a touch on his arm checked his progress. To
his surprise, he encountered the solemn face of
Le Corbeau.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?"</p>

<p>"To talk with you," the lips answered, but the
eyes said, "You are under arrest."</p>

<p>"I was expecting it," he replied calmly, "but
not from this quarter." He sought his friends,
but the movement of the crowd had divided them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>"After all, it is better so," he said to himself;
"farewell would be equivalent to a warrant."
He turned to his captor: "Where are you taking
me?"</p>

<p>Le Corbeau, without change of feature, ignored
the question and kept the silence. Resigning
himself to the situation, Goursac allowed himself
to be conducted with the crowd; but all at once,
as they entered the Rue Antoine, he felt an
impress on his other arm and another voice
saying:</p>

<p>"This way."</p>

<p>This time he perceived Sans-Chagrin, who,
without other recognition, drew him off the
thoroughfare. They penetrated abruptly into a
nest of narrow streets, winding and twisting in a
manner that left him completely in doubt as to
their direction. But as their general progress
seemed to be leading them toward the Cour des
Miracles, that cesspool of beggars, thieves, and
cutthroats, he began to fear that this capture had
some other design in view than his imprisonment.</p>

<p>He quitted his attitude of indifference and
summoned all his faculties to find a reason for
this strange course. Observing that at each
corner they turned his captors were forcing him
into a wider circle, the conviction grew in him
that they took this subterfuge to see if they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>followed. At the next corner he himself turned&mdash;without
success. But at the third attempt he
distinguished, lurking behind, the three incongruous
figures of Cramoisin, Boudgoust, and Jambony!</p>

<p>Then no longer doubting that he was being
led to his death, he resolved that no weakness of
his should add to the satisfaction of his enemies.</p>

<p>But at this moment, as for the twentieth time
they turned a corner, he was seized under the arms
and rushed at a run down an alley. Through an
entrance in the end he was propelled through
courts, hallways, and passages innumerable, and
suddenly emerged into a distant street.</p>

<p>Goursac, now utterly at a loss, made no resistance
to this sudden doubling. Only when, after
a few anxious blocks, he perceived that they
were no longer followed, he again sought to
enter into conversation with Sans-Chagrin, to be
met by the same obstinate silence.</p>

<p>Their attitude increased his perplexity, which
was now augmented by their totally ignoring
the direction of the prisons and striking out for
the barriers of the city. Not until the Barrière
du Trône Renversé itself was in sight did his
captors stop. Entering an inn, they gave a sign
of recognition to the host, passed down a hallway,
and pushed their prisoner into a large room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>where he found himself in the presence of Dossonville.
At the sight of the agent de sûreté, Goursac
drew himself up haughtily.</p>

<p>"So, Citoyen Dossonville, you turn with the
wind," he said. "I did not suspect your versatility."</p>

<p>"Heavens, my dear Goursac, yes!" cried
Dossonville. "But if I go with the wind, I
hope to be of some use to those who oppose it."
He pointed to the table. "That package will
interest you."</p>

<p>"There is some mistake," Goursac said, as he
scanned the document. "This is a passport for
the Citoyen Jacques Monestier."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that&mdash;Citoyen Monestier?"</p>

<p>Goursac looked at the passport, and from it to
the laughing countenance of Dossonville.</p>

<p>"Then it was to save me," he said slowly,
"that you had me arrested?"</p>

<p>"Parbleu! You are waking up!"</p>

<p>With one bound, Goursac caught Dossonville
in his arms.</p>

<p>"Pardon, pardon! What a fool I am!" he
cried. "My noble, my generous friend! Head
of an ass that I have on my shoulders! You
risk your life for mine! Thanks, thanks; a
thousand times, thanks!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" Dossonville broke in. "We understand
each other now. We have but little time;
listen to me." He stopped the other in the
torrent of his protestations. "Only remember
this, that if a weather-vane turns to every breeze,
it relinquishes its base not a jot, not even to the
hurricane. I find therein a great moral." He
dismissed the thought with a gesture. "Now
for you. You must pass the gates immediately.
When Javogues discovers your escape, he may
give orders to watch all the gates. See here,
my friend&mdash;you must listen to me."</p>

<p>Goursac was paying not the slightest attention.
Seated on a chair, his face aglow, he regarded
Dossonville with almost adoration, while from
time to time his emotion exploded in words.</p>

<p>"Dossonville, you are heroic! You are sublime!
Oh, if I only could acquaint the world
with such an action! Magnificent! Heroic! Heroic,
I tell you!"</p>

<p>Dossonville, perceiving his joy, thought to himself,
"Yes, heroism before death is all very well,
but how the hope of life transforms a man!"
Aloud he continued, "Take the passport and
hurry."</p>

<p>Then Goursac, retreating a step, said but one
word:</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>But in the word, with the flash of his eye, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>the toss of his head, with the resolution of his
lips, there was the eloquence of an oration.</p>

<p>This time it was Dossonville who was overcome
with astonishment.</p>

<p>"You are mad!" he exclaimed, seizing him
by the lapel. "If you return, it is to the guillotine."</p>

<p>"So be it!"</p>

<p>"Reflect."</p>

<p>"I have. Had I wished to save myself, I
should have done so long ago."</p>

<p>"Then you seek death?"</p>

<p>"I will not fly from the scum," Goursac said
proudly. "I am a Girondin and a Frenchman.
When I can no longer live as a Girondin, I am
ready to die as a Frenchman. Liberty? What
do you offer me? Exile and a daily cringing from
discovery, a miserable, hunted existence in the
mud and rain? No!" He took a step forward
and grasped his hand. "For what you have
risked for me accept my benediction; may it
bring good luck."</p>

<p>"At least, take the passport," said Dossonville,
desperately, holding it out to him, "so that if
you change your mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So that I may not change my mind&mdash;there."</p>

<p>With a rapid motion Goursac tore the passport
in two, embraced Dossonville, and went out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>Before the Prêtre Pendu, Cramoisin, Boudgoust,
and Jambony, more dead than alive, hung
their heads in terror while Javogues, like a
wounded bull, strode backward and forward before
them, filling the air with his imprecations.</p>

<p>"Come, you lie, one and all. You lie, Cramoisin;
you lie, Boudgoust; you lie, Jambony.
He has bought you with gold! You have sold
yourselves!"</p>

<p>"I swear they escaped us through some passage!"
Boudgoust cried.</p>

<p>"We searched an hour," Cramoisin put in.</p>

<p>"Shut up!"</p>

<p>Javogues seized him furiously by the shoulders,
and approaching his gleaming eyes as though to
force the truth from his face, he shouted:</p>

<p>"You lie! You lie! I see you lie!"</p>

<p>Abandoning him, he seized Jambony, shaking
him like a whip; but as he opened his mouth to
roar forth fresh denunciations, he stopped short
and dropped the cub in amazement. At the
same moment a murmur ran throughout the
crowd, which, parting, disclosed the approaching
figure of Goursac.</p>

<p>The Girondin perceived his enemies by the
same motion of the crowd; but without faltering,
he continued nodding to the acquaintances who
now shrank before him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<p>He had passed the cabaret and was almost at
the entrance of No. 38 before Javogues could
recover. Then, with a roar, he cried:</p>

<p>"Stop!"</p>

<p>Goursac wheeled, returned, and halted.</p>

<p>"What do you wish of me?"</p>

<p>Javogues, brought thus to the long-desired
moment, folded his arms and said brutally:</p>

<p>"You do not rejoice, citoyen, at the death of
traitors."</p>

<p>"I always rejoice at the death of traitors."</p>

<p>"You rejoice to-day, then?"</p>

<p>"I grieve."</p>

<p>He pronounced the words sadly.</p>

<p>"You are against the Revolution. Say it."</p>

<p>"I believe the Revolution is so great that its
ideas can survive even the massacre that you
assassins have begun." Then interrupting the
catechism disdainfully, he said: "Enough. I
should never have survived this day. Arrest
me."</p>

<p>Javogues, too overcome with rage for utterance,
consigned him with a furious gesture to his
body-guard. From all sides went up a shout
of hatred and anger. Children and women
crowded about, vying with one another to insult
the prisoner; men shook their fists in his face
and hooted. Amid curses and raillery, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>Girondin walked with collected steps, looking
into the ranks of his foes with steady eyes.</p>

<p>They had gone but a block when they encountered
Nicole and Barabant. At the sight of
Goursac in custody, surrounded by the snarling
pack, the two, obeying only their generous impulses,
sprang forward with outstretched hands:</p>

<p>"What, you, my friend!" Nicole cried, in
astonishment and sorrow. "They have arrested
you!"</p>

<p>"No, they are liberating me," he answered,
with a smile. He pressed their hands. "Adieu,
Nicole; adieu, Barabant; and thanks."</p>

<p>But suddenly the voice of la Mère Corniche
rose shrilly:</p>

<p>"He is the friend of the Girondin. He is
contre-révolutionnaire. Arrest the man Barabant!"</p>

<p>Cramoisin took up the cry.</p>

<p>"He who pities an enemy of the Nation is a
traitor. Arrest him!"</p>

<p>Boudgoust and Jambony, joining in, shouted:</p>

<p>"Arrest him! Arrest him!"</p>

<p>In the abject crowd, terrified by these four
men, a murmur, a muttering, a rumble, circulated,
which it waited to convert into either protest
or approval as Javogues should pronounce.</p>

<p>As the Marseillais unwillingly approached,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>Nicole, dragging Barabant back, whispered in his
ear that eternal cry of woman:</p>

<p>"Save thyself. Thy life belongs to me."</p>

<p>"Citoyen Barabant," Javogues said sternly,
"did you greet this man as a Girondin?"</p>

<p>"I greeted him," Barabant said slowly, "as a
man who has done me kindnesses in the past."</p>

<p>Before this allusion to his own indebtedness
Javogues hesitated, but the cries of the crowd
urged him on.</p>

<p>"He evades the question!"</p>

<p>"He's a Girondin!"</p>

<p>"Ask him if he's a Girondin!"</p>

<p>The last cry, from la Mère Corniche, imposed
itself above the rest.</p>

<p>"Citoyen Barabant," Javogues asked, "are
you a Girondin?"</p>

<p>As Barabant hesitated, Nicole sought the
glance of Goursac, invoking his aid. The Girondin,
who saw no one but her, perceiving her
motive, thought bitterly: "I die, and she cannot
spare me a look of pity!"</p>

<p>The crowd was clamoring.</p>

<p>"He hesitates!"</p>

<p>"He refuses!"</p>

<p>"Arrest him!"</p>

<p>At their cries, Barabant decided.</p>

<p>"I am not a Girondin," he said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>
<p>A chorus of approval greeted the renunciation,
but la Mère Corniche, not to be balked, cried:</p>

<p>"He is deceiving us!"</p>

<p>Those who wished to save him called to him:
"Cry, Vive les Jacobins!"</p>

<p>Barabant, all escape denied him, shouted:</p>

<p>"Vive la Nation! Vive les Jacobins!"</p>

<p>Then, while la Mère Corniche and the three
were silent in helpless rage, the crowd, which
adored Barabant, surrounded him, slapping him
on the shoulders, shaking his hand, congratulating
him. With one accord the shout went up:
"Vive Barabant!"</p>

<p>When the shouting died, Nicole heard the
rasping voice of Goursac saying to his captors
with triumphant sarcasm:</p>

<p>"I see no further need of delay; proceed."</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>



<h2>VII<br />
<small>THE MADNESS OF JEALOUSY</small></h2>



<p>The victory was to the woman, but it was
a victory fraught with menace. Nicole
understood her danger, but in her anxiety she
adopted the wrong defense. On the stairway she
infolded Barabant with her arm, seeking to communicate
to his depressed body the gaiety and
relief in hers, while with all the artifices of the
woman who feels herself menaced she sought to
belittle the importance of the scene, little realizing
the deep wound to the pride of Barabant.</p>

<p>"It was for me you did it," she whispered.
"You would not leave me. I alone understood."</p>

<p>He did not answer, and once in their room, fell
into a chair, burying his head in his hands.
Alarmed at his obstinate silence, Nicole, groping
for the right attitude, began to reason, walking
the floor in her earnestness.</p>

<p>"After all, mon ami, that is what the Terrorists
want&mdash;to guillotine the Moderates. Goursac
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>was foolish; he played into the hands of his
enemies. You are wise. The duty of the
Moderates is to keep silent, to preserve themselves
for the good of the Nation. How can
you serve the Nation without your head? The
times will change, mon ami, and you'll be here
to help set things aright."</p>

<p>"Oh, that voice," cried Barabant, "I hear it
always."</p>

<p>"Mon ami, you are suffering!" she exclaimed.
"I know. I understand."</p>

<p>She threw herself at his feet, trying to separate
his hands, seeking to take his head upon her
shoulder; but Barabant resisted, saying:</p>

<p>"No, Nicole, no; leave me to myself."</p>

<p>"Don't put me away," she begged. "You
are suffering; let me share it."</p>

<p>He took her hands from his neck and compelled
her to rise. She went to the window,
twice turning to look at the dejected figure that
remained unaware of her glances.</p>

<p>"I have made a blunder. Yes, I have made
a blunder," she said to herself, pressing her hand
against her lips to quell the rising sob. "He
blames me."</p>

<p>The next morning she received another shock
when he informed her that he wished to be alone
all day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then we don't lunch together?" she cried,
frightened.</p>

<p>"Not to-day."</p>

<p>Not daring to contradict him, she let him go
without a word.</p>

<p>"He blames me. He blames me," she told
herself, until all at once, like a thunderclap,
came the thought: "Or is it only a pretext?"</p>

<p>Her judgment tumbled before the suggestion,
and on the moment she was surrounded by the
old doubts. She hurried out, morbidly sensitive
to the glances of the concierge, of the loiterers
before the cabaret, of the bouquetières her comrades;
seeing everywhere mocking glances or
looks of sympathy. Despite Barabant's wish
and her better judgment, she scoured his haunts
with the one desire to know what he was doing.</p>

<p>After a day of agony spent in fruitless travel,
she returned to their room, without a glimpse of
Barabant. Having prepared the meal, she sat
down before the fire to wait impatiently the hour
of seven, when he would return. Beside her
chair she placed a redingote of his and sewing-material.
In the disorder of her mind all
her naturalness had departed, and seeking everything
with artifices, she wished him to come
upon her as she watched their supper and busied
herself with his wardrobe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>
<p>"That will soften his resentment, perhaps,"
she thought. "And that everything may be
cheerful, I must be singing."</p>

<p>So, when later the stairs gave out the sounds
of footsteps, she hurriedly possessed the mending,
humming as she sewed; but the steps ceased
two flights below. The redingote slipped from
her hands, the song stopped, and, overcome with
disappointment, she cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, mon Dieu, it is not he!"</p>

<p>When seven arrived and she began to be
anxious, she consoled herself with the thought
that the effect would be better if he found her
waiting without complaint. A burning smell
warned her that the dinner was spoiling. She
removed the pots from the fire, placing them for
warmth in the ashes, and, abandoning all thought
of the picture she had imagined, went to the
window, where she remained, pressing her hands
against her temples, staring into the misty night.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock she returned into the middle
of the room, and looking about at the scene of
her happiness, she said with conviction:</p>

<p>"It is ended!"</p>

<p>Traveling ceaselessly back and forth like a
panther, she cried: "Yes, yes, it is ended!" Still,
as long as she repeated it, she continued to hope,
and at each fancied creak she ran to the landing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>leaning over to catch his first footfall. But when
she returned, she still said:</p>

<p>"No, no; I knew it. It is ended&mdash;ended!"</p>

<p>At ten she ceased to repeat it,&mdash;she was convinced.
She collapsed on the bed, brain and
body incapable of effort, while the cruel minutes,
in their inexorable procession, inflicted each a
separate torture.</p>

<p>When midnight announced itself, the last
thread of hope snapped within her. She
bounded up, lit a candle, descended the flight,
and entered the room, calling, "Goursac!"</p>

<p>She had forgotten the arrest. The fact appeared
to her as an evil omen, presaging calamity.</p>

<p>In fear of the sepulchral stillness, she fled
back, rushing in a panic to her room, where she
gazed about helplessly, asking herself what she
was to do. All at once, at the window, staring
at her old room, she cried:</p>

<p>"If it is Louison!" And emitting an "Ah!"
that had in it the note of murder, she passed out
of the window.</p>

<p>The night was filled with fog, out of which
descended the sharp sting of rain. She moved
slowly, her body pressed to the roof, seeing with
her fingers until the dormer-window struck against
her foot. Once into Louison's room, she crept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>to the bed, stretching out her hand. It was
empty.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh!"</p>

<p>The cry was of something collapsing in her
soul. Without returning to her room, she sped
down the stairs, through the two courts, and into
the street. In her unheeding rush, she turned to
the right, missing Barabant, who was at the
moment returning from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>When she could run no longer, she dropped
into a walk until, recovering her breath, she
broke again into a run. At the street corners
the bracketed lanterns suffused the fog with a
floating radiance that guided her over the glistening,
slippery stones. The mist that threatened
the world with a destiny of gloom, the rain that
gathered on her eyelashes and weighted her hair,
she welcomed as the fitting touch to her misery;
but the chill abated not a jot of the fever in her
veins. Out of the blurred night occasionally
long lines of watchers emerged, crouching under
shawls, hugging the walls to escape the rain.
A dozen brutish arms snatched at her, but eluding
all, she arrived, panting and trembling, at her
destination, crying to the servant who answered
her knock:</p>

<p>"Citoyenne, is this the Committee of Safety?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>
<p>"I must see them."</p>

<p>"Do you come to denounce some one?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Enter."</p>

<p>Nicole found herself in a hall.</p>

<p>"Name, citoyenne?"</p>

<p>"The Citoyenne Nicole, bouquetière. The
Citoyen Couthon will know me."</p>

<p>The servant passed to a door at the back and
knocked timidly. At the second repetition a
voice cried:</p>

<p>"Come in."</p>

<p>The door opened on a group of men about a
table littered with papers.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"A citoyenne who wishes to make a denunciation."</p>

<p>"Name?"</p>

<p>"The Citoyenne Nicole, bouquetière."</p>

<p>"Tiens! I know her," exclaimed a voice. The
spokesman, on this evidence, gave a sign of permission
to the servant, who ushered in Nicole.</p>

<p>A voice said approvingly:</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;she is pretty."</p>

<p>"Haven't the time."</p>

<p>Several, attracted by the exclamation, gave her
a casual glance; the rest, without raising their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>heads, continued the low hum of their conference.
From the farther side a man wrapped in
blankets, deformed, infirm, seized with sudden
chills, greeted her.</p>

<p>"Well, Nicole, you've come to denounce
some one? That's right."</p>

<p>"Citoyen Couthon," Nicole blurted, "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the aspect of these machine-like men industriously
busy with the lists that fed the guillotine,
all her anger dissolved&mdash;she could not
pronounce there the name she had loved.</p>

<p>"Well, well," Couthon said encouragingly,
"you want to denounce whom? Come, let us
get at it. Not the Citoyen Eugène Barabant, at
least," he said, with a good-natured leer.</p>

<p>The sound of that name in this spot, without
pity, terrified Nicole; she now sought only an
excuse to retreat.</p>

<p>"What name's that?" cried a little man from
the table. "Eugène Barabant? Wait a moment;
wait a moment. Let me search."</p>

<p>Couthon lounged to the side of the speaker,
who, turning to his neighbor, demanded the list
of suspects to be arrested, while Nicole, flattened
against the wall, dazed by a sudden fear, remained
trembling at the snatches of conversation that
reached her.</p>

<p>"A man offered me one thousand livres to-day
if I'd slip in the name of his wife."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>
<p>"That was cheap!"</p>

<p>"Héron is becoming insupportable. He's
sent in the name of every one in his building.
To-day it's the woman above him."</p>

<p>"She makes too much noise, no doubt."</p>

<p>"What's the difference? The Nation needs the
funds. We must coin money on the Place de
la Revolution; the guillotine is the mint of the
Nation."</p>

<p>"You're a financier."</p>

<p>"I'm proud of it. Guillotine the rich&mdash;there's
my finance."</p>

<p>Couthon raised his head.</p>

<p>"That's strange; I too thought I'd seen the
name."</p>

<p>The others, attracted by his exclamation,
asked:</p>

<p>"What name?"</p>

<p>"Barabant. Eugène Barabant."</p>

<p>A small man spoke up.</p>

<p>"Denounced last night by the Citoyen Javogues
and an old hag the size of a child. Do
you remember?"</p>

<p>A chorus of assent greeted him.</p>

<p>"Barabant denounced!" Nicole cried. "Barabant
denounced!" She extended her hand.
"La Mère Corniche?"</p>

<p>"That's the name."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>
<p>"Come, Nicole, a lover is easily replaced.
I've sacrificed two already to the Nation," Couthon
cried. "Don't lose your time; denounce
your suspect. We are short to-night."</p>

<p>"A pretty patriot like that has right to a
dozen suspects," cried another, amid laughter.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed, dizzy, and horror-stricken, she
shook her head, felt with her hands until she
found the door, and, backing from the room, fled
from the house&mdash;fled back through the ghostly
city.</p>

<p>Goursac's door was opened; Geneviève herself,
with solemn face flushed with the light of her
candle, was waiting for her.</p>

<p>"Tell me quick!" she cried, apprehending
what had happened.</p>

<p>"You know, then?"</p>

<p>"Know what?"</p>

<p>"Barabant has been arrested."</p>

<p>She recoiled to the wall shrieking:</p>

<p>"Arrested!"</p>

<p>"An hour ago."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>"Here? Then he came back?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Without waiting to hear more, she fled to
their room. The lantern he had lighted shone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>over the stone floor, the cheerless walls, and the
kinks in the roof. It was all empty&mdash;terribly
empty. On the bed she perceived the belt and
the coat he had left. Forgetting her jealousy,
her anger, her mission, remembering only that
he had returned, knowing only that her dream
was ended, she stretched out her helpless arms
and cried:</p>

<p>"Barabant! Barabant!"</p>

<p>Then, overcome with hunger, weariness, and
the ravages of her emotion, she slipped to the
floor in a heap.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
<small>LA FÊTE DE LA RAISON</small></h2>



<p>On the 20th of Brumaire, day of the Feast of
Reason, maddest day the world has ever
known, the Revolution, having overturned the
social order, abolished the clergy, introduced the
monetary system, instituted fraternal banquets,
established popular education, and renamed the
calendar, now, as though unwilling that aught
should exist save in its image, decreed the abolition
of religion and set up the cult of Reason.
The neighborhood of the Prêtre Pendu, accustomed
as it was to the vagaries of its tyrants, was
yet astounded at the pitch of frenzy to which exultation
stirred the Marseillais and his companions.</p>

<p>The ecstasy of Javogues terrified all with its
frantic joy; for him the consummation of the
human race had arrived. He spent the morning
before the cabaret, astride a vat, dispensing wine
and hand-shakes, his arms in the air haranguing
the crowd that trembled to be present and dared
not stay away.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>
<p>"Religion is dead!" he bellowed to all comers.
"The farce is ended! The impudent bubble is
pricked!"</p>

<p>Boudgoust and Jambony, on either side, imitated
his fury and his gestures, while Cramoisin,
twisting in the crowd, made all he met shout to
the cry of:</p>

<p>"Vive la Raison!"</p>

<p>The listeners for the most part simulated enthusiasm,
with an eye to escape. A few echoed:</p>

<p>"Down with superstition!"</p>

<p>La Mère Corniche, hobbling into the midst of
them, extended her hand to Javogues in rough
familiarity, crying:</p>

<p>"Well, my big fellow, are you happy? What
a day, hanh? No more superstitions for us!
Touch hands."</p>

<p>"Touch there, mother!" Their hands met
with a clap. "Didn't I tell you, from the first,
there is no God?"</p>

<p>"Aye, you did. He never feared, that man!"</p>

<p>"I say it now," Javogues cried, and thrice he
shouted: "There is no God!"</p>

<p>Suddenly, flinging from the vat, he cleared a
space about him with his arm, and, seizing
Geneviève by the shoulder to steady himself,
cried:</p>

<p>"If there is a God, let him strike me down.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>Let the moment decide between us. I defy
him!"</p>

<p>He raised his fist to the sky and remained
waiting, while more than one closed their eyes in
terror. Then as the skies disgorged no thunderbolt,
his arm relaxed, descending to his side, and
the scornful lips with a sneer pronounced:</p>

<p>"Bah!"</p>

<p>"Vive Javogues!"</p>

<p>It was the voice of Cramoisin that acclaimed
the victor.</p>

<p>Abandoning Geneviève, Javogues caught from
the crowd a bakeress and a fille de joie and forced
them into each other's arms, crying:</p>

<p>"Embrace; the Revolution declares you sisters!"</p>

<p>Leaving the frightened women cowering, he
again seized Geneviève as a prop, and clearing
the throng, rolled up the street, invoking each
window with the exulting shout:</p>

<p>"Vive la Raison!"</p>

<p>While Cramoisin and Boudgoust combated
for the relinquished vat, Jambony, serving the
spigot, impudent and mocking, bellowed:</p>

<p>"Citoyens, it is not enough to wipe out cults:
we must level the steeples. Steeples are aristocratic.
What's the use of making Temples of
Reason of the ci-devant churches if steeples are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>to lord it over us. Steeples are the princes of
the city!"</p>

<p>"Citoyen, the Section des Bonnes Nouvelles
has already done so!" a woman cried.</p>

<p>"Then Vive la Section des Bonnes Nouvelles!"</p>

<p>With the departure of Javogues the crowd
grew noisy, disputing and haranguing. From
the top of the vat, which he had gained, Cramoisin
bellowed in vain to them to listen to his
ideas on the primeval innocence and the community
of women. The throng had turned to
another who, applauding the laws of burial, declared,
beyond interring each citoyen under the
simple tricolor flag, perfect equality could be
obtained only by identical tombstones.</p>

<p>All at once la Mère Corniche, who had remained
on the fringe of the crowd, shrank into
it with an exclamation of fear. At the entrance
of No. 38 appeared Nicole. On her face was
the brooding and the color of death. For a
moment she leaned against the wall, searching
uneasily among the crowd. Then, still seeking,
she approached, swaying from side to side, and
her eye fell on la Mère Corniche&mdash;and passed.</p>

<p>"It is not I," the old woman muttered, still
trembling from the suspense. "It's Cramoisin."</p>

<p>Then as Nicole, shaking her head, turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>wearily and went down the street, rubbing from
time to time against the wall, la Mère Corniche
said to herself, "Ah, it is Javogues!"</p>

<p>She sought the eye of Cramoisin. He was
still on the vat, struck dumb in the midst of a
furious harangue, following the girl as she disappeared
from sight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The concierge, in her fear, had guessed rightly:
Nicole sought the Marseillais. Her doubts of
Barabant, dispelled on the instant of his arrest,
had given place to bitter reproaches, to self-accusation,
and to an immense, confused hatred of
the man who had betrayed him. The separation
was irrevocable; she could see nothing
ahead. In the desolation of her hopes her anger
turned against the Revolution. Barabant guilty!
Barabant, the generous, impulsive advocate of
great ideas, a traitor! At such a thought her
whole being rose in revolt against the Revolution
that would destroy him. Without distinguishing
its abuses from its truths, reasoning
from men to ideas, revolting at the doctrine of
the community of women that menaced her
pure ambitions, she saw the Revolution only in
the furious figure of Javogues, brutal, despotic,
and mad. Shrinking from her comrades, without
faith, without hope, adrift, with the figure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>of Charlotte Corday ever before her, tormented
with the thought of martyrdom, she followed
Javogues, restlessly keeping him under her eye,
seeking him with an instinctive impulse that
gradually and fearfully shaped itself in her
resolution.</p>

<p>The streets where she wandered were filled
with barbaric processions from the sack of the
churches. Unshaven heads crowned with gorgeous
miters, ragged bodies clothed in purple
robes, smudgy arms brandishing golden chalices,
crucifixes, and relics swept by with exultant,
mocking chorus. In the churchyards troops of
beggars demolished monuments and leveled the
tombs, while still others beheaded the stone
images in the niches of the doors.</p>

<p>Toward night the lowest elements of the
social order were unchained. The drunkards,
the thieves, the idiots, the pariahs, the beggars,
the destitute, the morbidly curious, the shrews,
the hags, the harlots; all who hated the good
and many who had been taught to regard religion
as the shackles that fastened them to servitude,
erupted into the night, to mock the Church
and dishonor it.</p>

<p>Listless, troubled, and uneasy, through the
demented city Nicole continued her search,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>stopping neither for lunch nor for supper, sorting,
without success, each successive throng, while
every scene of license and sacrilege that inflamed
her anger steadied her resolve.</p>

<p>In the church of St. Gervais she stopped, appalled
at the riot. Within, shrieks of laughter
mingled with hoarse shouts of men and the
surging rhythm of music. Horror and rage possessed
her, and she plunged in, seeking Javogues,
while her hand went nervously to her
breast.</p>

<p>The church was dim with the smoky glimmer
of lamps, which veiled the interior in a
mantle of fog. The fishwives from the Marché
St. Jean offered salted herrings to all comers,
poisoning the air and disgusting the nostrils,
while on their track followed limonadiers with
overtopping tanks, rattling their cups and hawking
their beverage.</p>

<p>In the Chapel of the Virgin a hundred couples
were dancing, bumping into one another, hilarious
with wine and hoarse with shouting; while
above the carnival, enthroned on the altar, a
blue and white Goddess of Reason, a girl of
fifteen, watched the rout, arranging her scarlet
liberty-cap or extending her hand with conscious
smiles to those who acclaimed her.</p>

<p>Among these women whirling with closed
eyes and tumbled hair, among the reeling men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>Nicole glided until satisfied that the Marseillais
was absent; then she left the unholy halls and
ran, panting, to St. Eustache.</p>

<p>There, inside the entrance, the uproar halted
her, and she remained, in bewilderment, gazing
down the enormous length, asking herself if her
senses had departed.</p>

<p>The great vista was transformed into a
country-side; at her elbow were rustic huts and
clumps of trees, while in the distance, hidden
under the foliage of thickets, rose mounds that
echoed to the creaking of planks under the rush
of feet. Suddenly a hand caught her arm and
Dossonville's voice cried:</p>

<p>"Nicole, are you mad!"</p>

<p>Angry at this interruption to her plans, she
turned with a gesture of impatience; but Dossonville,
without relinquishing his grasp, continued
sternly:</p>

<p>"You cannot stay, you cannot!"</p>

<p>"I am going to."</p>

<p>The next moment some one seized her by the
waist; she turned with a scream. It was Cramoisin
who, unaware of her identity, had caught
her.</p>

<p>At the sight of Nicole he relaxed his hold, in
such utter terror that he stumbled and fell on
his back, when a band of women seized him by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>the arms and legs and bore him raging into the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Diable!" Dossonville muttered to himself.
"If the beast recognized me, I am done for."
Then taking the girl's arm, he repeated: "Nicole,
you cannot remain; it is impossible."</p>

<p>"I can protect myself," she said savagely.</p>

<p>"Nicole&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I must stay!"</p>

<p>In a moment Dossonville guessed something of
her design, and withdrawing a step, said sternly:</p>

<p>"Whom are you seeking?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"You are meditating something desperate."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You will not come?"</p>

<p>She shook her head impatiently.</p>

<p>"Then my life is in your hands; I will not
leave you."</p>

<p>Satisfied with this solution, that offered her a
certain protection, Nicole inclined her head, and
caring little how far she betrayed herself to him,
hastened feverishly into the throng. The loathing
and hatred which communicated itself to
her body banished all other senses; her breast
rose tumultuously, her forehead grew ugly with
anger, while her restless eyes beheld the saturnalia
without comprehension.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>
<p>Silently she dragged him about the great
space. On the altars of the chapels were spilled
bouquets and bottles of wine pell-mell with sausages,
pâtés, vegetables, and meats. A score of
hands clutched the food, scattering it over the
steps, splashing the altars with the red stains
of wine. The people gorged, drank, embraced,
and fell sprawling; while at times, with a
drunken cheer, some one in the tangle would
hurl a sausage or a ball of dripping bread at the
statues and portraits above, crying:</p>

<p>"There's for you, ci-devant Virgin!"</p>

<p>"Eat a little and become a good republican!"</p>

<p>Out of the scramble, boys and girls were
thrust forward to plunge their tiny hands into
the food in sign of liberty, while bottles of wine,
snatched from the famished lips of beggars,
were held out to them, until in their intoxication
they furnished amusement to the ribald
crowd.</p>

<p>"Pass on, pass on," cried Nicole.</p>

<p>A rush of women brushed them against the
wall. In the procession were tossing a dozen
statues capped with liberty-bonnets. In front
of them, a woman, leaping forward, embraced a
statue in her arms and bore it crashing to the
floor.</p>

<p>At the next chapel, Dossonville felt a sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>tension on his arm. Within, a band of madmen
and crazy women were performing a mockery of
a mass. Before a half-naked girl in stupor on
the altar Boudgoust was kneeling, while Jambony,
insolent and sneering, swung a chain of
sausages to and fro as censers.</p>

<p>Below the figure of the Goddess of Reason had
been placed a hastily constructed guillotine,
which Boudgoust elevated and replaced, pouring
over it a libation of red wine, announcing:</p>

<p>"The blood of aristocrats we offer thee!"</p>

<p>Then turning, he led the uproarious congregation,
crouching below, in a litany:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"St. Guillotine, protector of patriots, pray for us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Guillotine, terror of aristocrats, protect us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely machine, have pity on us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Admirable machine, have pity on us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Guillotine, deliver us of our enemies!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Pass on, pass on," Nicole cried, after the
unavailing search.</p>

<p>"If it is not they, it is Javogues," thought
Dossonville, who had been wondering whom she
was seeking.</p>

<p>They left the chapels and emerged into the
aisle, where no sound predominated and everything
was heard; where it seemed that Hell,
having overturned Heaven, was struggling to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>annihilate itself in the need of venting its
wickedness.</p>

<p>For a moment Nicole forgot herself, aghast
at the frenzy of her kind. She raised her eyes
in terror to the deep vaults stretching upward
undisturbed, serene and awful, as though from
the dim regions, which in her childhood she had
peopled with visions, the avenging thunderbolt
was about to smite the scoffers.</p>

<p>On every side the shouts grew wilder. Vile
women, dropping the mask of their sex, pursued
men in long, haggard, furious lines over the
artificial mounds that groaned under the chase.
The half-naked figure of Cramoisin appeared,
surrounded by bacchantes, exhorting the crowd
to return to the primitive innocence. Forms
meaningless and confused flitted, whirled, reeled
before them in an unending danse Macabre,
while mingled with the tempest came the ever-exultant
shout:</p>

<p>"Vive la Raison! Vive la Raison!"</p>

<p>Suddenly, by the catch of her breath and by
the involuntary "Ah!" Dossonville knew that
Nicole had found Javogues.</p>

<p>Without awaiting her leap, he hurled himself
on her and bore her back into a thicket, struggling
and pleading and burying her teeth in the
hand that muffled her screams. Then when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>mad struggles had snapped the bonds of consciousness,
he picked her up in his arms and
bore her quickly out through the unbridled mob,
who broke into applause, believing her overcome
with drunkenness.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>



<h2>IX<br />
<small>AS DID CHARLOTTE CORDAY</small></h2>



<p>Behind Dossonville the riot and the tumult
fell to a whisper; the titanic upheaval
ended with the walls. Above, the night was
solemn and gentle, and the Seine, toward which
he bore Nicole, unconscious of the revolt, flowed
with the serenity of ages. Depositing the girl
on a bench, he busied himself with recalling her
to the quiet world.</p>

<p>When consciousness returned, it was by flashes
where the incoherent words, jumbled and wild,
showed she was still in the saturnalia, preparing
to spring at the hated figure of the Marseillais.
Fearing that her cries would attract a crowd,
Dossonville shook her. She opened her eyes,
saw him, and sat up, seeking to assemble her
thoughts. Then a groan escaped her as memory
returned.</p>

<p>"Ah, my friend," she said pitifully, "why did
you stop me? It was the moment."</p>

<p>She put down her feet, smoothed her dress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>and stood up, while Dossonville, rising, said peremptorily:</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?"</p>

<p>"Home. Give me your arm. You were too
strong; I am tired."</p>

<p>"Nicole," Dossonville began, in the hope of
diverting her mood, "let us reason a little. That
is not the Revolution: that is the scum. Judge
it not by that."</p>

<p>"You say that," she answered wearily&mdash;"you?"</p>

<p>"Aye, the Revolution has proved too immense,
and the leaders too weak. It has rolled
over them; but the world is its path, and time
will right it."</p>

<p>But Nicole, despite all his artifices, refused to
say another word until in the Rue Maugout he
cried sternly:</p>

<p>"Nicole, what do you intend to do?"</p>

<p>"Is that so difficult to guess?"</p>

<p>"Nicole! You are not going to take your
life!"</p>

<p>"My life?" she answered, shaking her head.
"That is all that is left to me to use."</p>

<p>"Javogues's?"</p>

<p>She took his hands, smiling, and said:</p>

<p>"To-night I was mad and you could stop me;
now I am calm and you can do nothing. Good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>night. Forgive me if I have endangered your
life. Good night, my friend, good night."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the profound sleep of exhaustion Nicole,
the next morning, struggled to open her eyes with
the echo of Goursac's name sounding in her ears.</p>

<p>"Nicole! Hé, Citoyenne Nicole!"</p>

<p>She rushed to the window, and, leaning far out,
beheld below in the misty court the abhorrent
figures of the three Tapedures. At her appearance
they sent up the exultant shout: "Goursac
dies to-day!"</p>

<p>"To-day," she repeated dully, watching their
departure without emotion.</p>

<p>It was still early, and the weak sun, filtering
through the fogs of the November morning,
cast yellow shadows where shadows showed
at all. Silent and calm, the girl withdrew and
began to dress. Within her soul the torment of
the last days had given place to quiet. What
she had recoiled from doing as an individual
now appeared easy to her as the instrument of a
high vengeance. In her now were the revolt of
womanhood, the anger of the Christian, and the
resolution of a Charlotte Corday, which is the
resolution of a people.</p>

<p>Slowly and with great care she dressed, examining
herself often, selecting her best attire, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>as she dressed she began to sing, wondering the
while that she could feel so light-hearted. From
the bureau she took her dagger and a ring that
Barabant had left, slipping it on her finger, saying
wistfully:</p>

<p>"Poor Barabant. I might have betrayed you.
Ah, I shall make reparation."</p>

<p>In the elevation of her soul he seemed very
distant, and the room of her happiness, as she
paused meditatively, unreal and no more a part
of her life. She went to the bed and knelt, closing
her eyes and stretching up her clasped hands.
Suddenly she took the dagger from her breast
and placed it as a cross before her, fastening her
eyes upon it as her lips repeated her prayers.</p>

<p>She rose, passed out of the room, and without
a tremor descended the stairs. But at Goursac's
landing the sound of voices below compelled
her to halt and withdraw into the room. In the
turning her skirt caught on a splinter and was
torn.</p>

<p>"Ah, what a misfortune!" she said to herself,
unconscious of the incongruity of her words.
"My best skirt, too."</p>

<p>Her mind, before the immense decision, took
refuge in trifles. She sought a pin and occupied
herself with hiding the rent, while from time to
time she exclaimed impatiently:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>
<p>"They are taking a long time!"</p>

<p>Unable to remain still, she passed out to the
landing, whence, fancying that she had detected
the name of Barabant, she stole down the steps
as far as the turn would permit, shrinking against
the dark walls. Almost immediately the door
opened and the voice of Javogues said:</p>

<p>"He shall not escape, I promise it! Within
three days Barabant shall look through the little
window of Mother Guillotine!"</p>

<p>"But how'll you find him?" replied the
querulous voice of la Mère Corniche. "Some
one has transferred him from the Luxembourg."</p>

<p>"Never fear. I'll search the prisons and
drag him out, in spite of all the Dossonvilles in
Paris."</p>

<p>"But when?"</p>

<p>"This morning. There, will that satisfy you,
old patriot?"</p>

<p>A grunt came for all reply, and the next
moment the ascending flight creaked with the
weight of the concierge.</p>

<p>Nicole, thus threatened with immediate discovery,
seized her dagger in a desperate resolve,
but the advance stopped and the voice of la
Mère Corniche whispered:</p>

<p>"Nicole has gone out, hasn't she?"</p>

<p>"No, she is above."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then it is better to wait."</p>

<p>To the inexpressible relief of the trembling
girl, the old woman turned and descended.
Left in security, Nicole resumed her composure.
Without fear of failure, without once debating
the means she should employ, confident that all
that was essential was to be in the presence of
the tyrant, she descended, entering the room so
softly that Javogues turned with a startled:</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Nicole."</p>

<p>"What are you stealing in like a cat for?"</p>

<p>"I have come to speak with you."</p>

<p>"Speak."</p>

<p>"Why do you persecute Barabant?"</p>

<p>"He is a traitor!"</p>

<p>"But he said he was not a Girondin."</p>

<p>"He lied."</p>

<p>"But what is his offense?"</p>

<p>"He would show mercy to the aristocrats."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" she cried. "Have you forgotten
to whom you owe your life? You did not scorn
his mercy!"</p>

<p>Instead of the expected explosion, Javogues,
without resentment, replied:</p>

<p>"Because I remembered that I did not listen
when they told me Barabant was contre-révolutionnaire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>I have done a great wrong: I considered
myself instead of the Nation." He rose with
the glance of the fanatic. "Yes, I am guilty&mdash;I,
Javogues! But I will denounce myself. If the
Nation decides that I must be punished, let my
head warn others against moderation!"</p>

<p>"Javogues," cried Nicole, recoiling, "have you
not a drop of human blood in you? Have you
pity for nothing? Does not the sight of all the
blood spilled on the guillotine satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"Satisfy me?" he laughed. He elevated his
arms, repeating it with a clap of laughter. "That
little pool of blood satisfy me? Only an inundation
can purify France. Twenty executions a
day would not satisfy me. The guillotine is too
merciful for traitors. I would drown them by
hundreds&mdash;these aristocrats&mdash;these rich&mdash;these
Moderates who have crushed us for ages. If
those we smite are not guilty, their fathers were!
We must be revenged on the ages."</p>

<p>Then addressing Nicole furiously, he cried:
"See here, my girl; if you talk of moderation,
you'll go, too!"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Then suddenly,
from below, she heard the voice of Dossonville
calling:</p>

<p>"Nicole! Ho, Nicole!"</p>

<p>Without was life; within the dim room, martyrdom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then you think," she said, looking down,
"that Barabant is guilty?"</p>

<p>"He shall die!"</p>

<p>She was smiling with a deceitful smile as she
answered:</p>

<p>"You are perhaps right. Moderation is wrong.
We have suffered much."</p>

<p>"Well said!" Javogues cried. "There speaks
the patriot."</p>

<p>"Nicole! Nicole, come down!" cried the
voice without.</p>

<p>"It is that traitor Dossonville," Nicole said,
still smiling. "He does not know that Goursac
is to die to-day. Call it down to him. That
will enrage him."</p>

<p>With a gleam of joy, Javogues turned to the
window; but before he had made two steps,
Nicole, bounding forward, buried her dagger between
the vast shoulders. The hands went frantically
into the air, a hideous sound choked in the
throat, and, spinning around, the great bulk
tottered and collapsed at her feet. A moment
before was martyrdom, now nothing but
horror.</p>

<p>Hysterical, panic-stricken, holding out her hand
before her,&mdash;the hand that bore the curse of blood,&mdash;the
girl fled from the room, shrieking:</p>

<p>"I have killed him!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>
<p>At each flight, shivering as though the specter
pursued, she repeated:</p>

<p>"I have killed him! I have killed him!"</p>

<p>She rushed from the doorway into the court,
haggard, stretching away the accusing hand, and
streaked across the court into the arms of Dossonville,
screaming always:</p>

<p>"I have killed him!"</p>

<p>Above, the face of Javogues, purple and choking,
appeared a moment at the window, and fell
back, crying:</p>

<p>"Help! Help!"</p>

<p>From the four walls the windows put forth
frightened heads. Two or three half-dressed figures
came tumbling into the court. But Dossonville,
seizing the maddened girl, rushed her away
through the passage and up the street before the
startled lodgers could divine what had happened.</p>

<h2>X<br />
<small>UNRELENTING IN DEATH</small></h2>




<p>Placing Nicole in safety in the Maison
Talaru, a privileged jail, of which the
keeper, Schmidt, was his friend, Dossonville, picking
up Le Corbeau and Sans-Chagrin, returned to
the court, now packed with excited women.
Forcing his way through the press, heedless of
questions, he mounted the stairs, to find the room
of the Marseillais black with the curious crowd,
who shouted advice or sobbed hysterically as
they strove forward. Raising his voice, Dossonville
thundered:</p>

<p>"Silence!"</p>

<p>There was a lull, and a hasty turning of
heads.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Nation I summon all
citoyens to depart! The Nation takes possession."</p>

<p>Then followed a ludicrous sidling, shifting
rush for the door as each, fearing to be marked
for arrest, strove to depart unnoticed. All at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>once the long arm of Dossonville shot out and
barred the way.</p>

<p>"Remain!"</p>

<p>Boudgoust fell back. Again, as Cramoisin
sought to escape in the shelter of a fat woman,
the prohibition rang out:</p>

<p>"Remain!"</p>

<p>Jambony next presenting himself, the arm of
Dossonville again denied the way. In the room
there remained at last but the wounded man,
unconscious on the bed, a bundle of humanity
crouching at the head, a doctor, and the three
Tapedures huddling together against the wall.</p>

<p>From the doorway, the solemn face of Le
Corbeau peered in, flanked by the mocking smirk
of Sans-Chagrin. Dossonville, master of the
quiet room, strode up and down in indecision,
with glowing eyes fastened on the frightened
three, who dared not meet the menace of his
glance.</p>

<p>After five minutes of this torture, during which
all awaited the order of arrest, Dossonville suddenly
halted, extended his hand, and cried:</p>

<p>"Pass out!"</p>

<p>Sans-Chagrin, fearing to misinterpret the command,
checked the foremost, asking:</p>

<p>"Citoyen, are we to arrest them?"</p>

<p>"Not now."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>
<p>Confident that the menace would rid the
city of the three, Dossonville turned anxiously to
the doctor.</p>

<p>"Well, citoyen, what's your verdict?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to be done."</p>

<p>"Will he regain consciousness?"</p>

<p>"It is possible&mdash;probable."</p>

<p>Dossonville frowned.</p>

<p>"How long will he live?"</p>

<p>"Not beyond the day."</p>

<p>Desiring to prevent all communication with
the outer world, Dossonville said, with a quick
resolve:</p>

<p>"Then I shall be forced to establish a guard.
The Citoyen Javogues is under arrest."</p>

<p>Turning to Sans-Chagrin, he gave orders to
allow no one to enter&mdash;a command which had
the desired effect of hastening the departure of
the doctor. Approaching the bed, Dossonville
became aware of the figure at its side, drooped
over an arm of the invalid that hung down.</p>

<p>"Mordieu! what's this?" he cried; and placing
his hand on the shoulder, he shook it.</p>

<p>The bundle resolved itself into the wild figure
of a girl.</p>

<p>"Geneviève!"</p>

<p>At the next moment the girl, recognizing him,
flew at him with a cry of hatred. Avoiding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>blind rush, Dossonville caught her by the arm,
crying:</p>

<p>"Eh, Le Corbeau, take her! Sans-Chagrin, go
to his aid!"</p>

<p>Feeling herself overpowered, the girl became
suddenly quiet, calculating, and dissimulating;
but from her eyes murder looked out.</p>

<p>"Take her below!"</p>

<p>The wild light died out in the girl, who, bursting
into tears, cried:</p>

<p>"No, no! Let me stay! Let me stay!"</p>

<p>"Diable! what a complication!" Dossonville
thought. Then, aloud, he cried roughly: "Impossible!
She must go!"</p>

<p>Geneviève, breaking away, clasped his knees,
imploring pity.</p>

<p>"Let me stay, good, kind Dossonville. See,
I kiss your hands. I'll be quiet. Let me
stay. I love him. I adore him. Don't take me
away from him now. I know he's going to die.
I'll be quiet. I'll bless you."</p>

<p>"Stay, then!" Dossonville cried angrily. "I
am a fool to do it."</p>

<p>The girl, released, flew to the bed and crouched
down, laying her cheek against the shaggy arm,
while the big eyes looked up with frightened,
thankful appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go and eat," Dossonville said, turning to Sans-Chagrin
and Le Corbeau. Accompanying them
to the hall, he added in a whisper: "Mingle
with the crowd; convey the idea of an assault.
Nicole was defending herself, you know. Return
in an hour."</p>

<p>He shut the door, straddled a chair, and folding
his arms on the back, with a glance at Geneviève,
who continued motionless, entered on his
vigil.</p>

<p>In the room the only sound was from the
troubled breathing of the wounded man. The
girl did not even shift her head; while on his
chair Dossonville, like a statue of melancholy,
waited the ebbing of life, musing at this end to
their conflict, marveling the while at the strange
antipathies that set men at each other's throats
from their first glance.</p>

<p>All at once Javogues, raising himself on the
bed, opened his eyes and stared at Dossonville,
who matched the delirious glance with a quiet
gaze. Javogues, without deviating, stared stupidly,
then as suddenly fell back into apparent
insensibility again; while Geneviève, dragging
her body along the floor, wound her arms about
the bull-neck and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>Again the Marseillais rose and fastened his
uncomprehending stare upon Dossonville. Suddenly,
extending his hand, he cried:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>
<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>Falling back, he almost immediately exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It's Dossonville! Ah, Dossonville! Dossonville!
Spy! I have you at last!"</p>

<p>"He is still delirious," Dossonville muttered,
drawing breath. "I thought he saw me."</p>

<p>"I know it by the look in his eyes!" Javogues
cried from the bed. "I'll not give my hand to
a spy! Boudgoust, Cramoisin, Jambony, watch
him, follow him! Maillard, if he is acquitted, I
swear I'll cut his throat!"</p>

<p>At times he was at the siege of the Tuileries,
again in the court of the Abbaye, or again back
in the cabaret of the Bonnet Rouge on the night
of their first encounter. The flash burned itself
out again and he dropped into further insensibility.</p>

<p>A knock was heard on the door. Dossonville,
shifting slightly, said:</p>

<p>"Come in."</p>

<p>Le Corbeau and Sans-Chagrin tiptoed in and,
at a sign, noiselessly took their places against the
wall. Slight as was the interruption, it caught
the senses of the wounded man and seemed to
clear his vision. He opened his eyes and recognized
the room. A moment he remained frowning;
then, turning to the girl, he said with a note
of tenderness:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah, Geneviève!"</p>

<p>A sob escaped from the girl.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" he cried,
but immediately added: "Ah, I remember."</p>

<p>Presently he said roughly:</p>

<p>"Tell me, child; what is it?" Then, as the
girl buried her face in the bed to choke the sobs,
he answered himself: "It is death."</p>

<p>His eyes fixed themselves on the foot of the
bed, and a great breath passed through his body.
Presently a movement of Sans-Chagrin's crossed
his vision, and he raised his glance to Dossonville.</p>

<p>"You are here to see there's no slip," he said
scornfully.</p>

<p>"Javogues," Dossonville said impulsively, "I
bear you no hatred."</p>

<p>"But I do!" Javogues cried fiercely. "I have
never compromised with you. I'll not do it
now." Turning to Geneviève, he regarded her
a moment, and then said softly: "Kiss me,
mignonne; I know you love me." For a moment
pain checked his breathing. "Take my
hand. That's it. Don't let go of it."</p>

<p>"Javogues, as a mere formality," Dossonville
broke in, "do you wish a priest?"</p>

<p>"A priest! Yes, a priest!" Javogues cried,
with a laugh of scorn. "Spy, you would make
me out a hypocrite!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>
<p>"Man, have you no terror of God?"</p>

<p>"There is no God!" With the cry, the Javogues
of the mob rose up, carrying Geneviève
to her feet.</p>

<p>"Have you no doubts?"</p>

<p>"Bah!"</p>

<p>"And if there be a God?"</p>

<p>"And if there be a God, I do not fear him!"
he cried; and in the Titan the unconquerable
revolt of the Jacobin flamed out. "If there be
a God, he shall answer to me for what he has
done! In the name of the slave and the harlot,
I'll accuse him; in the name of the galleys and
the prison, in the name of those who grind out
their lives with the labor of beasts, in the name
of the famished and the leper, in the name of
those who groan under kings and aristocrats,
in the name of the poor, who fight for breath, for
food, for sleep&mdash;in the name of all misery, I'll
accuse him! If there be a God, he shall answer
that!"</p>

<p>The effort exhausted him; he collapsed.
The listeners, struck with terror at the audacity
of the atheist, composed themselves with long
breaths.</p>

<p>Dossonville transferred his glance to Geneviève
bending over the hand she never quitted.
A half-hour passed without a movement from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>the girl. It began to grow dark, and on the
quieter air the sound of voices reached them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dossonville, waiting patiently, saw
the girl raise her head and begin to rub the hand
she held. Then she stopped, sank back, and
pressed the hand against her heart.</p>

<p>Presently she raised her head and gazed in
perplexity at Javogues. She half rose, and dragging
her body forward, seized the head between
her hands, calling anxiously:</p>

<p>"Javogues, Javogues!"</p>

<p>Almost immediately she recoiled, bounding to
her feet, her hands to her temples, staring aghast,
while the cry was torn from her heart:</p>

<p>"He's dead!"</p>

<p>With a scream she rushed past them out of
the room, and fled down-stairs. Dossonville,
approaching the bed, looked down upon the
body that was Javogues's. He looked and
looked, forgetting all else, until Sans-Chagrin
impatiently touched his arm. Then, with a
start, he came to himself and led the way from
the empty room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>



<h2>XI<br />
<small>NICOLE FORGOES THE SACRIFICE</small></h2>



<p>The Maison Talaru, where Dossonville presented
himself the next day, was the
strangest of all the strange prisons improvised to
suit the needs of the Revolution. Crowded with
aristocrats, it remained unmolested, thanks to the
enormous sums its lodgers paid for their security.
In return, the inmates passed the time in agreeable
intercourse, gambling, amusing themselves,
and eating well. Schmidt, the jailer, not without
a touch of humor, replaced the enormous
dogs which attended his confrères by a peaceable
lamb, whose neck and feet, decorated with pink
bows, never failed to reassure the new arrivals.</p>

<p>Placed in his lucrative position by the aid of
Dossonville, Schmidt had nothing to refuse his
protector; but, as he was at bottom avaricious,
he met him with an anxious query as to the
probable duration of Nicole's stay.</p>

<p>"What difference can that make to you?"
Dossonville replied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>
<p>"The fact is, citoyen," Schmidt began cautiously,
"the citoyenne has a room to herself, at
your request, which brings me in eighteen livres
a day, which makes five hundred and forty livres
a month, which makes six thousand six hundred
livres a year. It's a good sum."</p>

<p>"Mordieu! what gratitude you must bear me,
my friend!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" the jailer hastened to say, but
with a doubtful inflection. "The ci-devant Marquis
of Talaru has only a little office, and he
pays that price."</p>

<p>"But he is the proprietor, I thought?"</p>

<p>"He rented the place to the section for six
thousand six hundred livres."</p>

<p>"The price you charge him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good! So he pays you back, for the privilege
of remaining a prisoner in his own home,
the amount of your rent. Excellent! And they
say we republicans are lacking in wit! As for
you, citoyen, reassure yourself; the Citoyenne
Nicole is here but temporarily."</p>

<p>"Eh, she can stay as long as she wants,"
Schmidt said hastily, with an eye to future
patronage. "I only wanted you to know that I
have gratitude."</p>

<p>"And its extent," Dossonville replied with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>smile. "Lead the way with your lamb. Did the
citoyenne remain quiet? Did she eat anything?"</p>

<p>"A nothing&mdash;a sip and a nibble."</p>

<p>Somewhat apprehensive at this symptom, Dossonville
approached her room and entered with a
hearty "Well, and how goes it?"</p>

<p>Nicole, still exalted and intense, without replying,
came forward, questioning him with a glance.</p>

<p>"Reassure yourself, Nicole; everything is for
the best," he said. Then, unable to meet the
persistent search of her eyes, he admitted grudgingly:
"Javogues is dead."</p>

<p>She inclined her head.</p>

<p>"When you kill a man, you know it. There
is an intuition. What do they say of me?"</p>

<p>"Everything turned out miraculously," Dossonville
answered joyfully. "My men were on
guard. No one entered. Javogues did not betray
you. The belief is that you stabbed him to
save yourself." Without noticing the revolt in
her eyes, he continued eagerly: "You are in no
danger. I have routed the Tapedures for the
present. In a week I'll transfer you to the
Madelonnettes, where I have Barabant safely
tucked away. There you can wait until the tide
sets against the Terrorists, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, perceiving his blunder, while
Nicole, smiling a little at his confusion, said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why do you stop?"</p>

<p>As he began again lamely, she interrupted:</p>

<p>"No, Dossonville, you see as well as I that it
cannot be. Why does every one wish to save
me?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dossonville, you do, and you see your
mistake. You would make me out a murderess.
I am not a murderess. I gave my life to the
Nation in exchange for Javogues's. I killed him
to save Barabant, to save a hundred others who
would perish if he had lived. As a patriot, I
killed him to deliver the Nation of a monster.
Only my life can justify the deed. Don't you
see?" She took his hands in hers, saying:
"Dear friend, bring me before the tribunal and I
will bless you."</p>

<p>"And Barabant?" Dossonville said desperately.</p>

<p>She shook her head. In her present exaltation
all that seemed like another life which she
had renounced for martyrdom.</p>

<p>"And Barabant?" repeated Dossonville.</p>

<p>"Tell him I did it to save him. He will
venerate my memory." She added slowly:
"Then I will hold a place in his heart that no
woman can ever take. That will be for the
best."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>
<p>"Nicole, listen to me," cried Dossonville.
"Listen, for what I say is true. Denounce yourself,
and you will drag Barabant to his death.
Once admit your reasons for killing Javogues,
and Barabant dies as your accomplice."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!"</p>

<p>Recoiling before this immense, inexorable obstacle
to her purpose, Nicole fell to her knees,
imploring him with her hands:</p>

<p>"No, no, Dossonville, you are telling me that
to save me."</p>

<p>"Yes, to save you; but it is true. Decide for
yourself, but your confession sends to the guillotine
every friend you have!"</p>

<p>"Dossonville! Dossonville! You are plunging
a dagger into my heart!"</p>

<p>"Listen, Nicole; I swear to you it is the truth,"
he said, raising her from the floor to a chair.
"Denounce yourself now, nothing can save him.
I say no more; decide for yourself."</p>

<p>Leaving her limp with despair, he departed,
well satisfied that the leaven would work and that
time and reflection would temper her resolve.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day, instead of returning, Dossonville
sought out Barabant, obtaining from the
frantic lover a letter to Nicole, which he had
delivered by the medium of Schmidt. Each day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>ignoring the demands the girl sent him by the
jailer, Dossonville repeated the same tactics, confident
in the power of lovers' logic to sway her
finally.</p>

<p>One misfortune disturbed his triumph. On
the day following Javogues's death, Louison informed
him of the execution of Goursac. Dossonville,
who from his fruitless efforts to save the
Girondin had retained a deep sentiment of admiration
for him, was much affected by the news, and
yielding to his anger, scoured the city for traces
of the three Tapedures. But despite the most
diligent search in café, market, and boulevard,
not a sign nor an echo could he find of the former
despots.</p>

<p>On the ninth day of Nicole's imprisonment,
Schmidt handed him a word from the girl, promising
to reason over the decision. But Dossonville,
though encouraged, divined that she would
meet him with fresh arguments, and absented
himself, until at the end of a week he received a
second message:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I renounce. Come."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then, satisfied, he mounted to her room, grumbling
to himself:</p>

<p>"Mordieu! one can't talk forever of dying
when one is young and is loved!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>
<p>To his alarm, she received him without protestations,
while her eyes, as they regarded him sadly,
conceded the victory, but reproached him for the
means.</p>

<p>"I must see him," she said simply. "Take
me to him."</p>

<p>"What then?" Dossonville questioned, suspicious
of her calm.</p>

<p>"I will do nothing to endanger his life."</p>

<p>"It is a promise?"</p>

<p>"I promise to do nothing that will endanger
his life," she repeated carefully.</p>

<p>"She is still determined to sacrifice herself," he
thought. "Mordieu! what an idea! Barabant
will make her forget."</p>

<p>That night, toward eleven, he conducted the
girl to Les Madelonnettes and restored her to Barabant.
Only the lantern of the jailer lighted the
sleeping halls as Nicole, with a cry, flew to her
lover's arms. In their happiness they forgot their
protector; but Dossonville, well content, withdrew,
drawing after him the guard.</p>

<p>"You seem different," Barabant said at last.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I have been away from you."</p>

<p>"How could you think of sacrificing yourself?"
he said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I was away from you," she repeated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>
<p>"You are here as my wife," he whispered.
"Citoyenne Barabant, you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But what is the matter? Why do you cry?"</p>

<p>"It is from joy," she said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then for the two prisoners began that weary
cycle of the prisons, days so incredible that even
those who survived looked back to them, doubting
their memory. Everything became monotonous;
scenes of heart-rending grief, partings of
mothers and children, husbands torn from their
wives, the experience of every day cloyed in the
lassitude that came from too much suffering.
Toward six in the afternoon they assembled in
the main halls, listening at first with faltering
courage, and then with indifference, to the turnkey
reading the list of those summoned to the
bar of the Revolutionary Tribunal.</p>

<p>The accused passed out, sullen, resigned,
hoping, trusting to a straw, indifferent, tired,
and their names were heard no more until the following
day, when a turnkey, with brutal exultation,
read the list of those who had perished on
the guillotine.</p>

<p>A shriek, a sob, a curse, perhaps, would be
heard, a sudden converging where a woman had
fallen unconscious; but the rest stolidly, dully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>counted the hours to the next summons. New
arrivals, the daily papers, an occasional letter,
brought them news of the fantastic, heaving outer
world. It was Frimaire, with tales of the drownings
at Nantes&mdash;republican marriages, where
man and woman, tied together, were thrown into
the river with brutal jests; Ventose, with its incredible
news that Hébert, the savage Père Duchesne,
and the bull-dogs of the Terror had fallen;
Germinal, more amazing than all&mdash;Danton the
lion and Camille Desmoulins, beloved of all,
swept into the common fate. And all the time
the prisons were bursting with suspects arriving
by hundreds from the sections, faster than the
guillotine could serve them.</p>

<p>In Nivôse the names of the Citoyen and Citoyenne
Barabant were called, and hand in hand,
without a word, they presented themselves.
They entered the rolling chariot, seeing again
the unfamiliar streets; but it was not to trial
that they were borne, but to another prison, the
Bénédictins Anglais. In Germinal they were
again called, and once more expecting death,
were again transferred, this time to the Prison
des Quatre Nations, with a glimpse of the sun
on the warm waters of the swollen Seine and the
breath of the spring that, as in mockery, brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>to their laps a shower of petals from the flowering
trees. Twice again transferred, they passed
through the Hôtel des Fermes and arrived in
Fructidor at Les Carmes.</p>

<p>Here new tortures awaited them from the hands
of their captors, clamoring for measures that
would empty the prisons of this constantly swelling
horde of suspects. First, the newspaper was
forbidden them, then all communication with the
outside world. On pretext that the aristocrats
were tempting the guards by bribery, a search
was instituted and all money and valuables were
seized. Later, another search was ordered, and
all knives, forks, razors, and pins were confiscated,
until for a woman to keep a hair-pin exposed
her to immediate trial.</p>

<p>These tyrannical measures, designed to provoke
complaint, failing of their purpose, the jailers had
recourse to petty tyranny, to insults and jibes.
Families were separated that they might feel the
force of punishment due their crimes. Miniatures
of loved ones were snatched from their
throats, with the brutal declaration that traitors
had no right to consolation. The vilest bread,
spoiled meat, decayed herring, were put before
them, and when still no complaint was heard the
turnkey, nonplussed and furious, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Damned aristocrats! What, we feed you
garbage and you won't complain!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>
<p>Of the two, Barabant, tired of the long suspense,
no longer retained any desire to struggle.
Nicole alone upheld his resolution, encouraging,
inspiring, invigorating him with her indomitable
gaiety.</p>

<p>In the long months, she had gone resolutely
and without subterfuge over the problem of their
relations. At first, in the new flush of happiness
at again possessing him, she had yielded weakly,
and, banishing from her mind the inexorable
figure of Javogues, she had turned to life and hope.
In the ascendancy that her courage took over
the limp resolution of Barabant she felt in herself
a new power, and in him a new need for her,
that tempted her with the bright vision of marriage.</p>

<p>As she began to reason the mood passed. For
the first time she saw him in the company of men
of intelligence and education, with whom he discoursed
on things that were to her a closed book.
Then she realized that between Barabant and herself
was a gulf of opportunity and interests which
she could never bridge. He too, she soon realized,
felt insensibly the distance between them:
she passed for his wife, but the constant reiteration
never suggested to him what it brought to her.
To become his wife was to be a drag to his
future; to remain as they were was to count the
hours of her youth. So, vaguely, in a confused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>intuition, the girl, struggling to understand what
was barred to her, grew to realize the limitations
to her life. It was a tragedy whichever way she
sought, but the tragedy had begun at the first
breath of love that had awakened her. So renouncing
the future, she returned to the thought
of sacrifice,&mdash;to save Barabant and, appeasing
the <i>manes</i> of Javogues, to dwell in her lover's
heart a bright memory of youth and devotion,
that would abide with him through life. Therein
she took her courage and all her consolation.</p>

<p>With the arrival of Thermidor, the Terrorists,
checked by the passive attitude of the prisoners,
introduced, as suspects among the prisons, spies,
who, succeeding by malignant imagination where
brutality had failed, denounced to the Committee
of Safety a conspiracy by which the prisoners
were to escape by ropes from the windows, overpower
the guards, and assassinate the Convention.</p>

<p>The pretext was found sufficient and elastic,
and the hecatombs began. The spies, called
<i>moutons</i>, prepared the lists each night that sent
troops of twenty-five or more each day into the
fatal chariots,&mdash;paralytics, men of seventy, feeble
women and maidens,&mdash;the crimes of all comprised
under the heading of intention to assassinate
the Convention. As fast as the prisons were
emptied the influx arrived, forcing more transfers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 7th of Thermidor, for the fifth
time, Nicole and Barabant were placed in the
chariots, to be conveyed to another prison.
Then Barabant, utterly tired, rebelled and
said:</p>

<p>"At last it is too much. I want to end it. I
can endure it no longer. Nicole, let me die now
and be through with the suspense. We cannot
escape. They are guillotining fifty a day. Next
month it will be a hundred. Let us be firm and
not await another month of torture."</p>

<p>"Then, Barabant, after all I have done," she
said reproachfully, "you would send me to the
guillotine?"</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"I follow where you go."</p>

<p>But their companions cried in alarm: "What
are you doing?"</p>

<p>"You'll betray us all!"</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, be silent!"</p>

<p>Barabant, without energy to pursue long any
determination, resigned himself wearily to their
protests and the appeal of Nicole.</p>

<p>The chariot rolled out into the streets, where
the passers-by, weighted down with the prevailing
depression, regarded them without hatred and
without curiosity. Their journey led them by
the gardens of the Luxembourg, resplendent with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>green and the glisten of cool fountains. In the
chariot some one said:</p>

<p>"Pleasant weather!"</p>

<p>"What good does that do us?" grumbled
another.</p>

<p>"I played there as a youngster; but what of
that?"</p>

<p>"It does not seem different. How curious!"</p>

<p>"Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"To the Porte-Libre."</p>

<p>"I was there in Prairial."</p>

<p>"What's it like?"</p>

<p>"The same as the rest."</p>

<p>The whispered comments ceased as the prison
loomed over them. The carts ground on the
cobblestones, passing the gate. From somewhere
among them a sigh was heard. A voice said,
with a low laugh:</p>

<p>"Here's the inn. All down!"</p>

<p>They passed to the office for identification and
enrolment, and on through a square into the
strange corridor to the hall, where a score of
inmates straggled in curiously to see if they
recognized any of the new arrivals. There, to
her despair, Nicole beheld, in the shadow of a
pillar, screened a little from the crowd, the face
she had dreaded for months to encounter&mdash;the
malignant face of Cramoisin, the Tapedure.</p>

<h2>XII<br />
<small>THE FATHER OF LOUISON</small></h2>



<p>The turbulent months which devastated the
city with the fury of a pest had been to Dossonville
an exhilaration. Paths beset with a hundred
pitfalls he ran with enjoyment, passing from
side to side with agility and alacrity, reveling in
intrigues, nourished by entanglements. But the
recrudescence of the Terror alarmed him in one
way, for it rendered him powerless to aid Barabant
and Nicole. He still watched over them,
but even he dared not risk a communication, for
the moment had arrived when it sufficed no
longer to be Jacobin or Moderate. To sleep
securely at home one must have been born lucky.</p>

<p>The death of Javogues and the disappearance
of Cramoisin, Boudgoust, and Jambony had left
the domination of Dossonville undisputed. Geneviève
alone remained; but the girl, violently cast
into womanhood by the spark of love, had relapsed
into childhood. He saw her once or twice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>struggling under the weight of a bucket of water,&mdash;a
child again opening its uncomprehending
eyes on the world.</p>

<p>Thus left to the liberty of his own pursuits,
Dossonville had passed the time running the
streets, nose in the wind, smelling out the popular
favor, prying, laughing, never abandoning his
equanimity, furious and frantic when it was necessary,
moderate and smooth of speech when
clemency was in the air.</p>

<p>So that the prudent, desiring no more than to
agree with the strong, had trimmed their sails by
the conduct of Le Corbeau and Sans-Chagrin, who
reflected the mood of their inscrutable leader. In
Nivôse, when a wave of pity swept over the
Convention, nothing could have been more touching
than the laments of Sans-Chagrin, while the
glance of Le Corbeau was benevolence itself.
Their weapons disappeared, replaced by boutonnières,
while, lingering behind their leader, they
jested with all comers.</p>

<p>With the news of the wholesale drownings at
Nantes and the revival of massacres, the two had
put forth cutlasses and pistols as a chestnut blossoms
overnight, and, stalking abroad with violent
gestures and furious speech, struck dismay in all
who met their suspicious glances.</p>

<p>But the leader who, with a sign, worked these
sudden transformations was always at the head,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>imperturbable, alert, and impudent, twirling as
his only weapon the little ivory wand with which
he whipped circles in the air.</p>

<p>Occasionally he saw Louison, when the execution
of a Mme. Du Barry or a Maillard drew him
to the spectacle of the guillotine. Between the
singular girl and himself there developed a curious
attraction and repulsion, which impelled or
checked his interest as regularly as the ebb and
flow of the tides. When he saw her on the
boulevards he felt strongly her magnetism, but
in the vicinity of the guillotine she caused him a
cold, almost repulsive, sensation.</p>

<p>So marked were her habits that a few had
even bestowed on her the soubriquet of "the
daughter of the guillotine." At the Cabaret de
la Guillotine, where at lunch the menu bore the
list of those to be executed in the afternoon, she
was pointed out as the one who had never missed
a performance. When discussions arose as to an
execution, it was always Louison who was appealed
to to decide.</p>

<p>This development astounded Dossonville,
then annoyed him, and finally aroused him to
such a pitch of disgust that one day he broke
out:</p>

<p>"Louison, it is not right, nor human, nor decent
to give way to such a curiosity. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>must stop it. It is dangerous. It will become
a mania. Already you seem at times inhuman."</p>

<p>"Others are there every day," she protested.</p>

<p>"But not like you. You must stop. What,
does it please you to be called the daughter of
the guillotine?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It is always pleasant to be
known."</p>

<p>"It is repellent."</p>

<p>"Don't come, then."</p>

<p>For a fortnight he absented himself, angry
and disturbed. But in measure as she ceased to
appeal to his interest she perplexed his curiosity,
and he was impelled more and more to study
her, seeking to understand the reasons of her indifference
to suffering and the evident absence of
emotion. At the end of two weeks, she met him
on the boulevards with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"Since you persist in regarding me as a curiosity,"
she said, "you might try what you can
discover. Mama is back."</p>

<p>Dossonville, without waiting to be urged twice,
made a trip to the shop of the wig-maker and
discovered that la Mère Baudrier had indeed
returned from the provinces. So that night, toward
eleven o'clock, he led his watch-dogs back,
relying on a plan of campaign which he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>imagined to force a revelation. Stationing Sans-Chagrin
at the door, under which showed a slit
of light, he knocked and entered without awaiting
permission.</p>

<p>A woman, shading a candle, came precipitately
down the stairs, crying:</p>

<p>"Who's there, and what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Are you la Mère Baudrier?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Descend; I wish to speak with you."</p>

<p>She came down slowly, regarding him with
alarmed surprise.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"The Citoyen Dossonville. I represent the
Nation."</p>

<p>Then, while the look changed to one of dismay,
she blurted:</p>

<p>"But what has the Nation to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Do not fear, citoyenne, you will have every
chance to excuse yourself."</p>

<p>"Then I am to be arrested?"</p>

<p>Dossonville, without replying, said:</p>

<p>"Lead the way to the back; I must speak
with you alone."</p>

<p>She obeyed, repeating:</p>

<p>"Am I under arrest? Am I? There's some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>mistake. I'm the Citoyenne Baudrier. Of what
can I be accused?"</p>

<p>"Exactly on that point I am to interrogate
you. It may be long; sit down."</p>

<p>La Mère Baudrier, trembling, took a chair,
never ceasing her mumbling.</p>

<p>"But what? I don't understand. Why,
every one will tell you that I am a patriot."</p>

<p>Dossonville, who had been a moment interested
in the resemblance of daughter and mother,
seized upon the last word.</p>

<p>"Citoyenne, there's the point: what constitutes
a patriot? Do you know the law of suspects?"
He tilted back his head and closed his
eyes, not so tightly though as to miss the expression
of her face. "These are declared suspects:</p>

<p>"All aristocrats.</p>

<p>"All priests.</p>

<p>"All Moderates.</p>

<p>"All those who, although they have done
nothing against the Nation, have done nothing
for it."</p>

<p>He examined the prisoner carefully as he continued,
emphasizing each word:</p>

<p>"All those who correspond with the enemies
of the country.</p>

<p>"All who habitually entertain strangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>"All those who in the past have been associated
with the aristocrats, whether as servant, mistress,
or friend."</p>

<p>"She does not seem to fear the word aristocrat,"
Dossonville added to himself. Then aloud:
"Citoyenne Baudrier, you are accused of favoring
the aristocrats."</p>

<p>A look of amazement overspread the woman's
features, which was so complete an answer to the
charge that he added quickly:</p>

<p>"Citoyenne, you are said to have been very
intimate in the past with the ci-devant nobles."</p>

<p>The blank look of astonishment gave place to
one of indignation.</p>

<p>"I? I, the Citoyenne Baudrier? Come,
that's a joke!"</p>

<p>"Citoyenne Baudrier, listen to me," Dossonville
said, checking the explosion, "you are accused
of having a daughter whose parentage you
will not reveal, because the father is a ci-devant
aristocrat and an enemy of his country."</p>

<p>At this point-blank accusation, to his surprise,
she rose and said scornfully, with her hands on
her hips:</p>

<p>"Ah, I see this is a trick of Louison's."</p>

<p>For answer he displayed the shield of an agent
de sûreté. La Mère Baudrier, overwhelmed, fell
back, covering her face with her hands, while a
single word escaped her:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>
<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Citoyenne," Dossonville cried sternly, "I
warn you that only by proving the parentage of
your daughter can you clear yourself. If you refuse,
you must answer before the Tribunal to the
accusation."</p>

<p>The woman shook her head without looking
up.</p>

<p>"Le Corbeau! Sans-Chagrin!" he called.</p>

<p>At the noise of their entrance into the hall she
sprang up, crying: "Wait! Wait!"</p>

<p>Giving them an order to halt, Dossonville returned,
saying roughly:</p>

<p>"Well, have you decided to speak?"</p>

<p>For a moment the woman remained swaying,
babbling to herself; then suddenly she sank back,
crying:</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly it is an aristocrat, and some one
formidable," Dossonville thought, seeing the pallor
of her face. Then, raising his voice, he called
his men.</p>

<p>At their entrance a trembling seized the body
of the woman, but at the sight of the mocking
face of Sans-Chagrin she recoiled as before a
vision, and a scream escaped her.</p>

<p>"The Curé Sans-Souci! The Curé Sans-Souci!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>
<p>"Who calls me by that name?" Sans-Chagrin
cried, his face assuming a look of amazement.
"Tiens! but I know that woman!"</p>

<p>Suddenly he struck his head.</p>

<p>"Of course!" he cried. "Pardi! what is
there so terrible about me? I was always a good
friend to you, La Glorieuse."</p>

<p>"You knew it, then, all the while?" the
woman cried, turning fiercely to Dossonville.</p>

<p>"I know nothing," Dossonville answered; and
seeing that chance had come in somehow to his
aid, he demanded curtly of Sans-Chagrin: "What
do you know of her?"</p>

<p>"A good deal," Sans-Chagrin began, with a
smile. "I confessed her when I was a ci-devant
curé in the days of fanaticism and error."</p>

<p>La Mère Baudrier, very white, extended her
hand for permission to Dossonville, who said
encouragingly:</p>

<p>"Allons, you are going to be reasonable
now?"</p>

<p>"I will speak." She turned to Sans-Chagrin.
"Citoyen Sans-Souci&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am Sans-Chagrin now."</p>

<p>"Citoyen Sans-Chagrin, they accuse me of
having a daughter by an aristocrat&mdash;Louison, the
bouquetière."</p>

<p>"But your little one was called Rose."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>
<p>"I changed the name afterward." For a moment
she was thrown into confusion, but rallying,
she continued: "You can say if the father was
an aristocrat."</p>

<p>"I should hope so: it was I that baptized her.
Come, now, what was he called? La Gloire&mdash;la,
le&mdash;no, Lajoie, Simon Lajoie, that's it."</p>

<p>"Simon Lajoie!"</p>

<p>The thunderclap was Dossonville's, who,
thrown off his guard, caught Sans-Chagrin by
the shoulder, repeating:</p>

<p>"Simon Lajoie!"</p>

<p>But immediately, by a violent effort, he controlled
himself, and dismissing them hurriedly,
turned his back on the frightened woman, seeking
to regain his composure. When he turned,
it was with the calm of intense excitement.</p>

<p>"Is that the Simon Lajoie who used to frequent
the Café Procopé?"</p>

<p>The woman remained dumb.</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good. Your explanations are sufficient.
You are released."</p>

<p>He watched the look of immense relief that
spread over her countenance as she rose, with a
mumbled thanks, and started for the door.</p>

<p>"By the way, citoyenne," he cried carelessly;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>"one moment. Come back. Sit down. Could
the Citoyen Lajoie have been any one in disguise?"</p>

<p>Terrified and trapped, the woman sprang up.</p>

<p>"For instance, the good Citoyen Charles
Sanson?"</p>

<p>Her answer was a shriek and the thud of her
body falling in a swoon to the floor.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>



<h2>XIII<br />
<small>DAUGHTER OF THE GUILLOTINE</small></h2>



<p>"Certainly, he is demented," Le Corbeau
cried when, after a dozen zigzags,
Dossonville continued to plunge furiously ahead
up street after street.</p>

<p>"Decidedly so," grumbled Sans-Chagrin.
"Here's three times we've passed the Tour St.
Jacques."</p>

<p>"What the devil could have happened?"</p>

<p>"You know Lajoie?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course&mdash;a little insignificant man."</p>

<p>"It was perhaps his brother."</p>

<p>"He hadn't the look."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I say it's time to rest."</p>

<p>"My legs are worn out."</p>

<p>"If we suggested a halt?"</p>

<p>"I don't dare."</p>

<p>"Neither do I."</p>

<p>Oblivious to their fatigue, Dossonville wandered
on in absurd circles, heedless of his surroundings,
while if he passed a corner three times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>he did not notice it once. Vain and proud in
his imperturbability, for the first time he was
completely unnerved by this vision of the executioner
that rose up at the side of the girl whom
he had been on the verge of loving. All at once
the mystery of her character was revealed, the insensibility
to suffering, the unnatural curiosity,
and the sang-froid beyond a woman.</p>

<p>"What an inheritance! What a curse!" he
repeated.</p>

<p>Under the broken silhouettes of the housetops
across the luminous sky, from out the mysterious,
vague corners of the night, there started up,
more ghostly and more sinister, the shadowy
dynasty of the Sansons, the pariahs accursed,
isolated, loathed, flinging themselves in vain
against the barriers of prejudice, striving to
escape into the obscurity of their fellows,
always discovered, always driven back on the
fingers of the crowd, that shrank away even as it
pursued.</p>

<p>Back of the furtive figure of Sanson appeared
the troop of malign ancestors, masked in scarlet or
in black, nonchalant in their blood service, while
behind hovered the red cloud of victims,&mdash;men,
women, priests, nuns, children and gray-heads,&mdash;in
long danse macabre around the ax, the gallows,
and the guillotine; and among the Sansons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>he saw, calm and uncomprehending, the figure
of Louison.</p>

<p>Suddenly above his head rose the twin shafts
of the guillotine, dominating the desert of the
night. Then trembling, aghast at this sinister
menace, Dossonville, with a cry of horror, turned
and fled from the inanimate thing that waited
there relentlessly the coming of the day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the first recoil from his personal association,
he had promised himself never again to encounter
Louison; but with the morning she seemed so
expelled from his past that, yielding to an overpowering
desire to study her in the light of his
new knowledge, he drifted, almost unconsciously,
to the Place de la Revolution.</p>

<p>The crowd in which he sheltered himself was
loose, not very attentive, nor very large: the
spectacle was old; there was not enough variety
in the performers. In front, scores of women,
seated indolently on their chairs, suspended their
knitting at each fall of the ax, counting:</p>

<p>"Twenty."</p>

<p>"Twenty-one."</p>

<p>At each execution a murmur wandered through
the crowd&mdash;a conventional, listless, slurred cry:</p>

<p>"Vive la Nation!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>Louison, never still, moved among the tricoteuses,
nodding and chatting. As each hum
announced the arrival of a victim on the scaffold
she turned for a momentary, prying glance; then,
without interest, wheeling about, she cried her
cockades, seeking in the crowd a likely customer.</p>

<p>Absorbed in the girl, marveling at the strange
and terrible forces that drew her back to the
parent scaffold, Dossonville fell into so deep an
abstraction that it cost him his concealment.
Before he could retire with the departing crowd,
Louison, perceiving him, had hastened to his side.</p>

<p>"What happened last night?" she said, with
an imperious gesture. "What did you say to
my mother?"</p>

<p>"How do you know I saw her?" he said,
unable to control a slight movement of recoil.</p>

<p>"I know it. What happened?" she demanded
impatiently. "I was there this morning, but she
was gone&mdash;gone during the night. What passed
between you?"</p>

<p>"You have been misinformed."</p>

<p>"Dossonville, you are deceiving me," she said,
looking in his face. "You saw her, and you
learned the name of my father."</p>

<p>Without allowing time for denial, she took his
arm and led him toward the Cours la Reine,
turning among the bypaths of the luxuriant
woods. There, amid the joyous gaiety of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>spring, under the soft foliage of the chestnuts,
she faced him with a peremptory question:</p>

<p>"You saw her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"She told you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Louison examined his face attentively.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you to-day, and
why do you conceal it from me? Did you not
promise to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then?"</p>

<p>"Nothing has happened."</p>

<p>"Dossonville, you are lying lamely," she said;
then she added, with a frown: "My father was a
great scoundrel, then?"</p>

<p>Dossonville did not reply.</p>

<p>"How stupid you are! You think it would
make a difference. How does it affect me?
Come, I am not responsible, no matter who it is.
Tell me. It cannot affect me."</p>

<p>"It will."</p>

<p>"Then you know," she said instantly.</p>

<p>Dossonville shrugged his shoulders. He desired
the appearance of resistance more than to
resist, for his curiosity was stronger than his pity.
But having thus betrayed himself, he added impressively:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>
<p>"Do not force me to tell you."</p>

<p>She began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Louison, I warn you, do not demand to
know."</p>

<p>"I do demand it. I insist."</p>

<p>"You will curse me."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" she cried, with a laugh. "Philippe
Egalité, a farmer-general, Bailly, Capet
even,&mdash;I mention the worst."</p>

<p>"Louison," he said shortly, "they call you the
daughter of the guillotine."</p>

<p>She stopped, perplexed.</p>

<p>"You are well named."</p>

<p>"Don't return to that," she said irritably. "It
was agreed we were not to mention that. Come,
don't keep me waiting. I tell you it will make
no difference."</p>

<p>"You absolve me?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Even if Sanson were your father?"</p>

<p>Louison burst out laughing, but suddenly she
broke off at the sight of his face.</p>

<p>"Is that serious?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She repeated, "Is that serious?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am the daughter of Sanson?"</p>

<p>Dossonville inclined his head, awaiting the
explosion. To his surprise, she remained quiet,
withdrawing a little, while her eyes still waited
on him, as though expecting a denial.</p>

<p>"How curious!" she said at length. "I never
thought of that. Ah, I understand why she hid
it. Now tell me all."</p>

<p>Seeing that she did not realize the extent of
the revelation, Dossonville quickly related the
facts, astonished at her calm, wondering what
force was working beneath the surface.</p>

<p>Louison, in fact, unable immediately to comprehend
the situation, continued to watch Dossonville,
as though to estimate from his behavior
the force of the change to her. Remembering
his attempted escape on the Place de la Revolution,
and alarmed at a new reserve in his manner,
she asked herself angrily, albeit anxiously, what
difference the knowledge would make in him.
To test him, she advanced a step and said, holding
out her arms as though to embrace him:</p>

<p>"Thanks, my friend; you have kept your
promise."</p>

<p>He withdrew but a step and only for an instant,
but that involuntary shrinking was her
sentence.</p>

<p>With a cry of despair, she bounded back,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>transformed with hot, revolting anger, her fingers
struggling against the temptation of the dagger,
crying to him:</p>

<p>"Go! Go quickly! Go now!"</p>

<p>Then, distrusting the murder in her heart, she
fled into the woods; but in a moment, crazed
with the cruel injustice of her fate, she came running
back, her lips trembling with passion, her
breath cut and quick. With his accustomed
prudence, Dossonville had retired by another
direction, leaving Louison to tire herself out
among the fragrant paths in fruitless, maddened
rushings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gradually among the tricoteuses, the bouquetières,
and the clientèle of the Cabaret de la Guillotine
it began to be whispered that something
extraordinary had happened to Louison. Her
manner had changed. She was no longer indifferent,
mocking, and careless under the scaffold.
Instead, her companions began to be alarmed at
the cloud on her brow, the brooding fixity of her
glance, the abruptness and the poverty of her
speech. Her questions were even stranger than
her moods. One day she asked of her companion,
thrusting her hand toward the guillotine:</p>

<p>"Does that affect you to see them die like
that?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>
<p>"I dream sometimes at nights," the girl answered.</p>

<p>Then Louison, turning on her an uncomprehending
glance, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"True?"</p>

<p>Another time she said:</p>

<p>"Doesn't that make you curious?"</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"Curious to know what you would do."</p>

<p>Those who repeated her remarks exclaimed in
apprehension and tapped their foreheads. As a
natural consequence, the most extraordinary rumors
arose. One declared that she had been
seen thrice at midnight prowling about the vicinity
of the scaffold. Another affirmed that he on
whom she looked with anger would perish.
Others, scorning these absurd rumors, gave it as
their opinion that her mind was shaken by her
unnatural obsession. The girl did not fail to
notice the change in the demeanor of her companions,
and, in her tortured imagination, ascribed
to it a different cause.</p>

<p>"Why do they draw away from me?" she
said once.</p>

<p>"It's your imagination."</p>

<p>"Are you superstitious?" she said disjointedly.</p>

<p>"I? A little."</p>

<p>"Why do they call me the daughter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>the guillotine? Doesn't that strike you as
odd?"</p>

<p>And she threw upon her companion a quick,
cunning glance, as though to surprise the momentary
confusion that would expose her real knowledge.</p>

<p>Thermidor began with the hecatombs from the
pretended Conspiracy of the Prisons, and the
transfer of the guillotine to the Barrière du Trône
Renversé. The great rolling biers, attended by
the scum of the city, bore each day to the scaffold
their thirty, forty, sixty victims. Even the Faubourg
St. Antoine, satiated and appalled, began
to grumble, while from time to time voices broke
out in protestation, willing from mere lassitude
to end the spectacle by their own sacrifice.</p>

<p>On the 6th of Thermidor, almost at the side
of Louison, a bouquetière, her comrade, cried
out:</p>

<p>"I am sick of it! Robespierre is a scoundrel.
They kill too many people. I want to die."</p>

<p>The next day she was on the scaffold, looking
down indifferently, contented to end the fatigue
of surfeited disgust.</p>

<p>Louison laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh?" her neighbor said.
"What has she done to you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not laugh at her," she answered impatiently.
"I laughed because I told her I would
go first."</p>

<p>Her companion edged away. The tricoteuses,
stopping their needles, counted:</p>

<p>"Forty-eight!"</p>

<p>At that moment Louison beheld Dossonville
on the outskirts of the crowd. Seizing the girl
nearest to her, a child of fifteen, by the shoulder,
she cried, with a furious gesture:</p>

<p>"Jeanneton, do you see that fellow over there?
He thinks I can't see him, the fool! As though
I cared!"</p>

<p>The child struggled to free herself, but Louison,
without relaxing her hold, transferred her look to
the scaffold. Twice again the murmur rose:</p>

<p>"Forty-nine!"</p>

<p>"Fifty!"</p>

<p>"Do you know what I am wondering?"
Louison said suddenly to the child whimpering
in her clutch. "How strange it must feel to be
there."</p>

<p>All at once, releasing the frightened Jeanneton,
she advanced toward the guillotine, as though
irresistibly sucked into the maelstrom, stopped,
drew her hand across her forehead, then, facing
the crowd, flung away her basket of flowers and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Vive le Roi!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>
<p>In an instant she was surrounded, while everywhere
the cries went up:</p>

<p>"She is mad!"</p>

<p>"She is drunk!"</p>

<p>"We have seen it for weeks."</p>

<p>"She is not responsible."</p>

<p>"She is a patriot."</p>

<p>Others insisted:</p>

<p>"Arrest her!"</p>

<p>"The Nation is insulted!"</p>

<p>"No favor!"</p>

<p>About the fringes of the crowd they questioned
excitedly, running to and fro:</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Louison."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Louison."</p>

<p>"She is mad!"</p>

<p>About her the mass struggled and swayed,
some crying to her to simulate drunkenness,
others clamoring for her arrest. In the center,
Louison, alone calm and indifferent, secure in
the knowledge of what must follow, continued
to regard the silhouette of the guillotine, while
about her lips was that curious smile which is
seen only on the face of the martyr or the insane.</p>

<h2>XIV<br />
<small>THE LAST ON THE LIST</small></h2>



<p>As Nicole, in the hall of the Porte-Libre,
stopped aghast at this apparition of their
enemy, Cramoisin perceived her, and scuttling
hurriedly forward, cried in triumph:</p>

<p>"Bonjour, Nicole. What luck, eh? Well,
aren't you going to say good day?"</p>

<p>"Bonjour," she answered hastily.</p>

<p>"And Barabant, too," he cried. "Better still,
and so glad to see me! Bonjour, Barabant."</p>

<p>"Ah, it's you, hypocrite!" Barabant answered
scornfully.</p>

<p>There was a movement of incredulity and
alarm among the prisoners, who hastened to
withdraw from them. Cramoisin, as though
whipped across the face, fell back, scowling and
cursing, while Nicole, seizing Barabant's arm,
cried:</p>

<p>"Barabant, what have you done?"</p>

<p>"Nicole," he answered, "do you remember
what Goursac said when they arrested him?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>
<p>"No."</p>

<p>"'They are liberating me.' Well, I too wish
to be free. I have lived like a dog for months.
That is ended. I will not cringe before this
bully, who will send us to-morrow to the guillotine."</p>

<p>"Then you are determined to die?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So be it."</p>

<p>They took their places at the long table, huddling
among the famished and the fever-racked,
while the scullions brought in pails the revolting
food. Anxious to learn the position of Cramoisin,
Nicole was about to question her neighbor,
an abbé whose kindly look encouraged her, when
Cramoisin, suddenly appearing at her shoulder,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Eh, Nicole, my dear, if you want to know
what I am doing here, ask me. I'll tell you. I
am the secretary of the Conspiration. I keep a
list of all the good conspirators and I see that
they are rewarded. I bring good luck. I've
been here but a week and we've guillotined
forty!"</p>

<p>"You know him?" the priest asked as the
bully swaggered down the line, and Nicole perceived
the slight movement with which he drew
away.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>
<p>"He is our bitterest enemy."</p>

<p>"Pardon," he murmured, regarding her with
compassion.</p>

<p>"We expect death," she answered quietly.</p>

<p>"What he says is true," he added in a whisper.
"Since he has been here they have taken forty
of us. He makes out the lists every night. We
live at his pleasure."</p>

<p>"Does he live among us?" she asked, with a
quickened interest.</p>

<p>Again Cramoisin returned, strutting with bombastic
gestures, crying to the room:</p>

<p>"I am the friend of Fouquier. Fouquier
promised me to-day that in two more weeks
we could put out a sign, 'To let.' Isn't he
kind to us, though? He's very sympathetic, is
Fouquier. And I am his friend&mdash;I, Eugène
Franz Cramoisin. He honors me with his confidence.
Eat in peace. I'll speak to him about
you. Don't worry."</p>

<p>He swaggered on, vaunting his intimacy,
loudly assuring them he brought good luck.</p>

<p>Nicole anxiously repeated her question.</p>

<p>"He keeps up the farce of being a prisoner,"
her neighbor answered.</p>

<p>"Where does he lodge?"</p>

<p>"Near you, where the new arrivals are put."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sangdieu!" rose again the voice of Cramoisin,
who, farther down, had halted at the side
of a woman. "The herring is rotten. Do you
not see it? Come, you must complain."</p>

<p>"It is all I need," came the faint answer. "I
am not hungry."</p>

<p>"Bah, you aristocrats, you haven't the courage
of dogs!" He returned to another: "And
you, young man, they treat you badly, eh?
Shall I complain to Fouquier?"</p>

<p>The youth, who had imprudently met his eye,
instantly dropped his head; but Cramoisin, amid
the jeers of the turnkeys, with a pretense of
listening for his answer, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What's that you say? Robespierre is a
scoundrel?"</p>

<p>"I said nothing!"</p>

<p>"Then you thought it, and thoughts are
offenses!"</p>

<p>Arrived opposite Barabant, he planted himself
with folded arms and cried:</p>

<p>"Well, Citoyen Barabant, the food's good,
eh?"</p>

<p>Pushing back his plate, Barabant likewise
folded his arms and answered with a sneer:</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"To me it is delicious!"</p>

<p>"That's not astonishing,&mdash;it's the food of
swine!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>
<p>A murmur rumbled over the hall, rising to
weak cries of protests:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He slanders it."</p>

<p>"We don't think so, citoyen."</p>

<p>Others implored Barabant to be silent, trembling
at his rash speech, that would suffice to
empty the prison. Under pretense of upbraiding
him, they surrounded him, beseeching him to have
a thought of their danger. Yielding to their terror,
Barabant remained silent; but when, after the
meal, they had dispersed to their rooms, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah, that did me good! I feel I am a man
again. Nicole, to-night I shall sleep soundly for
the first time in months, knowing that after to-morrow
I may sleep more soundly."</p>

<p>Waiting barely long enough to assure herself
of his unconsciousness, Nicole withdrew from his
side and stole down the corridor, seeking until
she found under a door a slit of light.</p>

<p>At her soft entrance Cramoisin started up in
alarm from the desk where he had been preparing
his list, and placed the chair between them.</p>

<p>"I am not come to harm you," she said disdainfully.
Still for a moment he eyed her in
doubt, before he was reassured. He grumbled:</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>
<p>From where she was she could see the list, and
at its head the one name she dreaded to find.</p>

<p>"Read, if you wish," he said indifferently.
"It will give you pleasure."</p>

<p>There were ten names in all, Barabant's being
the first, and hers was not of the number.</p>

<p>"I have something to ask of you."</p>

<p>"Ask."</p>

<p>"I do not ask that we be sent to the guillotine
together," she said, planning cunningly to avoid
one danger. "That would be too great a consolation
for you to accord us. Exchange my
name for Barabant's."</p>

<p>"Nini," he said, watching her with covetous,
blinking eyes. "I don't intend to let you go."</p>

<p>"If you will send me instead," she cried; "if
you swear it, swear to spare him, I will give you
a secret that will earn you the gratitude of Fouquier."</p>

<p>"You are too pretty," he said, with a smirk;
"when one is as pretty as that, one is a patriot."</p>

<p>"You will not accept?"</p>

<p>"What, after this evening?"</p>

<p>"Citoyen," she cried, "he is in a delirium! It
was the fever."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Citoyen, he admitted to me that it was unjust."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>
<p>"He shall go. You I'll keep."</p>

<p>"Citoyen Cramoisin," Nicole said coldly, "you
can never make me belong to you, if that is your
purpose. You are not Javogues, and I killed
Javogues. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Before the fire in her eyes Cramoisin shrank
away, mumbling:</p>

<p>"You are more difficult than the women of
the aristocrats."</p>

<p>"I give you my secret!" Nicole cried in despair.
"Use it for your own good. I did not
kill Javogues because he pursued me; I killed
him to destroy a tyrant. Place my name there
instead of Barabant's, and I will affirm it before
the Tribunal. You will have the credit of discovering
a plot. Fouquier will reward you."</p>

<p>"Is that your secret?" Cramoisin said contemptuously.
"Nothing new in that."</p>

<p>"What! You knew," she cried, "and held
back my name?"</p>

<p>"Bah! When one is dead, one is no longer a
patriot."</p>

<p>"Citoyen Cramoisin, listen. If you will put
my name on the list instead of Barabant's, I'll
give you all the money I have."</p>

<p>To her joy, he looked up with a sudden interest.</p>

<p>"How much have you?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>
<p>"Twenty livres."</p>

<p>At the mention of this amount, which Nicole
had managed to preserve, his eye became eloquent;
but suddenly controlling himself, he asked:</p>

<p>"Paper?"</p>

<p>"Gold."</p>

<p>"You have it with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Let's see it."</p>

<p>"When you agree."</p>

<p>"It is right to be merciful," he said at last,
with a sigh. "But I cannot spare him more than
one day."</p>

<p>"For a week?" she pleaded.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Six days&mdash;five?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Cramoisin, for pity's sake, four?"</p>

<p>"Never, never!"</p>

<p>"Cramoisin, by your hope of salvation!"</p>

<p>"I'll give you three; not another hour."</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand.</p>

<p>"No; erase first."</p>

<p>He took off the name of Barabant and substituted,
"The woman Nicole."</p>

<p>"What did you write?"</p>

<p>"The woman Nicole."</p>

<p>"Put the Citoyenne Nicole Barabant."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>
<p>"What! You are his wife?"</p>

<p>"Put it down."</p>

<p>"There! Give me the money."</p>

<p>"And you will keep Barabant's name until the
10th of Thermidor?" she said solemnly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Swear it."</p>

<p>"I swear it."</p>

<p>"On your honor."</p>

<p>"There, on my honor, then! Give me the
money."</p>

<p>She gave it to him, and suddenly casting herself
on her knees, she cried hysterically:</p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks! You have a heart, I know.
You will keep your word. You can pity. You
can be merciful. Thanks! Thanks!"</p>

<p>Catching the ugly, cruel hands in hers, she
covered them with her kisses and her tears.
Then, escaping, she fled down the corridor, returning
to bed, but not to sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the morning Barabant awoke, to find her eyes
open and the sunlight in the room.</p>

<p>"How well I slept!" he said, springing up.
Going to the window, he spread his hands into
the beam of the sun that entered. "That feels
good. Tiens, you have a strange look! What
is it? You are not afraid?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>
<p>"No," she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, what then?"</p>

<p>"I have something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you're all wrought up," he said, in
surprise, as she stopped.</p>

<p>"Barabant, I ask you only because there is no
hope of life. Barabant, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, mignonne, what is it? What has
happened?"</p>

<p>She threw herself in his arms, sobbing:</p>

<p>"Barabant, I want to be a wife!"</p>

<p>The moments that he held her in stupefaction
were moments of agony to her. He put her
from him, looking in amazement at the tear-stained
face.</p>

<p>"Idiot that I am!" he cried suddenly. "That
is what has been tormenting you!"</p>

<p>Waiting only for the accent of his voice, she
sprang back, trembling, not daring to look at
him.</p>

<p>"Then you will?" she cried, stretching out
her hands to him. "Then you will?"</p>

<p>"Of course!"</p>

<p>Into his arms she threw herself, sobbing with
the poignant ecstasy of joy, while he listened,
still uncomprehending.</p>

<p>"That means so much to you?" he said. "But
I always considered you as my wife."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>
<p>Even in her emotion his simplicity drew from
her a smile.</p>

<p>"Since when have you had this idea?"</p>

<p>"From the beginning."</p>

<p>"True?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"From&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From the afternoon of the 10th of August;
but I did not realize it then."</p>

<p>The correction summed up all her history.</p>

<p>All at once Barabant, rousing himself from his
amazement, said:</p>

<p>"But how are we to be married?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember the abbé next to us?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I will ask him."</p>

<p>"Do you think he will do it?" he said doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I know how to convince him."</p>

<p>He kissed her and drew her away from him.</p>

<p>"Shall I go?" she said. "Now?"</p>

<p>"Fly!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She was away a long time. When she reappeared
with the priest she said timidly:</p>

<p>"I have taken very long. I wanted to confess.
It did me good. Does that annoy you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said smilingly; and looking at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>face of her companion, he said to himself: "She
has made him cry."</p>

<p>They joined hands, kneeling before the black-robed
figure in the warm room, pervaded with
the sunlight that the bars on the window could
not arrest. He made them man and wife, and
blessed them, and, bending, put out his hands to
raise the woman. But almost immediately, with
a smile that was of the compassionate master, he
ceased his attempts and stole from the room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Tell me one thing," Barabant asked.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Why did you not ask before?"</p>

<p>"I could not ask. Now it makes no difference."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>Again and again, through their solitary afternoon,
as they waited, now silent, now questioning
each other, he returned to his query without success.
At five o'clock, perceiving in her body an
involuntary shudder, he said:</p>

<p>"You're not afraid of to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No. So many others have gone." She had
a superstitious idea of God and another world,
confused, simple, and sufficient. Thinking of
Javogues, she added: "The abbé said I should
be saved. Do you believe it?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes," he answered, respecting her faith. "I
shall not fear, either."</p>

<p>"I know," she answered dreamily.</p>

<p>"She does not think of me," he thought.
Then wishing to talk of himself, he said:</p>

<p>"It is life that I regret. I ought to have done
so much."</p>

<p>"I wanted to give you that," she said at last,
feeling in the air the approach of the last hour.
"I wanted to die for you. That was my dream.
You would have revered my memory and I
should have been happy."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" he said, frowning.
"And what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I am only an ignorant girl," she said. "I
could not long have been your companion."</p>

<p>"You are wrong," he cried vehemently, repeating
it several times, "and you do me an
injustice."</p>

<p>She yielded, and asked the question that had
been on her lips a dozen times:</p>

<p>"Truly, Eugène, you would have married
me?"</p>

<p>"Can you doubt it, Nicole?"</p>

<p>"You are good, very good." She smiled,
satisfied to bear this promise away with her, but
in her heart she was not quite convinced. "You
have been very kind."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>
<p>He was glad at such a moment to own a good
action.</p>

<p>"Do you know, it's good to have you," he
said slowly, a moment awed by the thought of
the morrow. "I do not fear, but I am glad you
are to be with me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>All at once she sprang up, trembling from head
to foot, crying:</p>

<p>"Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"The bell?"</p>

<p>"It is six."</p>

<p>"What! you are trembling?"</p>

<p>"Kiss me."</p>

<p>She threw herself into his arms, clutching him
to her, while he, in bewilderment, said:</p>

<p>"But I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Hold me, Eugène, hold me!" she cried.
"Don't let me go!"</p>

<p>She kissed him, holding his head in her hands,
and the kiss awakened in him the memory of
that first meeting of their lips, in the dark stairway,
under the weak torch. He placed his arm
about her waist, drawing her gently down the
corridor, and believing that her courage at the
last had failed her, he whispered as they went:</p>

<p>"Do not fear, little one. I am with you. I'll
have courage for us both."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>
<p>The prisoners assembled in the great hall, listless
and dragging their steps, searching among
themselves with anxious or mechanical curiosity,
seeking to divine the chosen. Soon from the
courtyard rumbled the wheels of the arriving cart.</p>

<p>Presently, faint at first, down the distant corridor
fell the step of the turnkey, approaching
slowly, as though to prolong the cruel suspense.
With a crash the gates were flung open, and,
flanked by two mastiffs, holding in his hand the
fatal roll, the jailer suddenly confronted every
eye. Without pause, the monotonous, singing
voice opened the long, dreary preamble, finished
it, and, rising to a shout, began the list:</p>

<p>"The Citoyenne Nicole Barabant!"</p>

<p>A sigh of relief escaped the girl, and her head
fell on the shoulder of Barabant; but her ears,
deaf to the cries of sorrow, to the lamentations of
mothers and wives, to the screams of astonishment
and despair that woke the silent hall, followed
anxiously the roll, counting:</p>

<p>"Seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine!"</p>

<p>At the tenth she relaxed, and her arms wound
about the neck of Barabant in the last long embrace,
violent with the pang of parting. Suddenly,
with a cry of despair, she tore herself from
him,&mdash;an eleventh name was being read:</p>

<p>"The Citoyen Eugène&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>
<p>Something extraordinary had happened; the
jailer had stopped in indecision. Nicole, in the
agony of her mind, saw but one face&mdash;the mocking
face of Cramoisin&mdash;against an opposite pillar.</p>

<p>"The Citoyen Eugène Franz Cramoisin!"</p>

<p>The sneer dropped out; the face grew livid.
On all sides astounded cries went up:</p>

<p>"Cramoisin?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Cramoisin arrested!"</p>

<p>Nicole, understanding nothing but that Barabant
was saved, hearing only Barabant's voice
demanding like a madman to be taken, fell into
his arms, crying:</p>

<p>"No, no, it is not a mistake! It is I who have
saved you. Barabant! Barabant! It is as I
wanted it! Remember me, Barabant! Don't
forget me! The abbé will tell you all. Barabant&mdash;Barabant!"</p>

<p>They tore her from his arms and swept her
away, still stretching out the unavailing fingers,
still calling:</p>

<p>"Barabant! Barabant!"</p>

<p>The weeping and the wailing died behind the
clashing gates. A woman, catching her in her
arms, supported her down the unending corridor,
whispering:</p>

<p>"Lean on me. I have no one."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>
<p>They entered the courtyard and climbed into
the chariot, where a few prisoners sadly and indifferently
watched their arrival. There presently
two turnkeys, laughing boisterously, bore out and
dumped beside them the body of Cramoisin, who
had fainted.</p>

<h2>XV<br />
<small>THE FALL OF THE TERROR</small></h2>



<p>On the 9th of Thermidor Dossonville, who
had long foreseen the inevitable conflict
of Robespierre and the Convention, resolved
on another rapid shift, and, appearing in the Rue
Maugout, denounced Robespierre and the Jacobins
in such unmeasured terms that he not only
sent his listeners galloping off to denounce him,
but to his amazement on turning about, found
himself deserted even by Sans-Chagrin and Le
Corbeau.</p>

<p>According to his custom, he visited the Conciergerie
to inspect the prisoners. Already in
the streets was the awakening of the great conflict.
In the crowds the Jacobins alone raised
their voices in furious boasting; but silence predominated,
and the silence told of anger and
condemnation.</p>

<p>In the first division he found no familiar face
among the twenty-odd prisoners until, on the
point of turning away, he discovered the abject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>form of Cramoisin. The downfall of the Terrorists
appeared to him as a favorable presage.</p>

<p>He passed to the second division; there the
crowd was thicker and more turbulent. Over the
uneven field of bobbing heads he saw the judges
on the bench, the listless jury, joking among
themselves, and the abhorrent figure of Fouquier;
while to the right, packed together on the benches,
were the score of prisoners who waited, without
hope, the mockery of a trial.</p>

<p>Dossonville, taking his place in the stream of
those who constantly pressed to the front seeking
the face of relative or friend, yielded good-humoredly
the right of way to those who sought
in sorrow. After some delay he reached the
front rank. There a cry was torn from him:</p>

<p>"Oh, mon Dieu!"</p>

<p>At the first glance he had seen Nicole. Drawn
by some subtle intelligence, she raised her eyes
and saw him.</p>

<p>"What a fatality!" he cried to himself. "She
herself has done this!"</p>

<p>A sudden anger filled him, of revolt and resentment
against the stubborn sacrifice of this
frail girl who had defeated him at the very
last. His glance of reproach she met with one
of content, which said: "You see, it is as I
said."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>
<p>She smiled seriously, a little sadly, as one who,
though not regretting the decision, had not foreseen
the cost.</p>

<p>A hand swept him back as others pressed fervently
forward. He heard a mother's voice cry
at his side:</p>

<p>"They have taken my child, my son."</p>

<p>His glance following dumbly the outstretched
hands, he beheld at the side of Nicole the figure
of a boy, who searched the crowd with frightened
face. The buzz of voices rose about, the
mother's mingling with the crowd.</p>

<p>"But it's a mistake. He's sixteen."</p>

<p>"Then don't worry, they can't touch him!"</p>

<p>"Aye, he's safe!"</p>

<p>"They arrested him for his brother, who's
twenty-six."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, la petite mère, any one can
see he's a boy."</p>

<p>"They'll release him?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;he's under age."</p>

<p>"Aye, any one can see that."</p>

<p>Dossonville but half heard them. He was
crushed by the cruel turn of fate that had claimed
her at the last, when the morrow would mean
life and security. His eyes, yet refusing to believe,
had never left Nicole's face. She was pale;
but the pallor was of serenity, and gave to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>person a certain distinction that seemed to raise
her above her class. From time to time a certain
pensiveness, whether of melancholy or of regret,
gathered in her eyes. She was looking with
womanly revolt below her, where, on a litter, exposed
to all eyes, lay the unconscious form of
a woman. The audience, rebelling against such
cruelty, began to murmur:</p>

<p>"Remove her!"</p>

<p>"Take her out!"</p>

<p>"Send her to the hospital!"</p>

<p>The cry was taken up, passing from a murmur
in the front ranks to volume and distinctness as
it rolled back. The protest became so insistent
that several of the jury began to cast anxious
glances at the audience, and a judge motioned to
Fouquier. There was an expectant lull; but
Fouquier cried, with a sneer:</p>

<p>"She'll revive. Call the roll!"</p>

<p>The storm that had subsided in anticipation
burst forth anew.</p>

<p>"No! No!"</p>

<p>"Remove her!"</p>

<p>"Justice!"</p>

<p>"Outrage!"</p>

<p>Near Dossonville a blacksmith, with leather
apron, was shouting:</p>

<p>"To the hospital!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>
<p>A red-haired man in a baker's cap, with
clenched fists, added:</p>

<p>"Tyrant!"</p>

<p>Fresh arrivals, bringing tidings of uprisings
throughout the city, gave new courage to the
protests. Fouquier, impressed at last by the outbursts,
rose sullenly and commanded:</p>

<p>"Bear the woman to the witness-room, but the
instant she revives bring her back."</p>

<p>The roll-call was begun&mdash;the simple attestation
of individuality that had replaced the pleas
of advocates and the taking of testimony. Encouraged
by its first success, the audience began
to murmur:</p>

<p>"They say the Quartier St. Antoine is in revolt
against Robespierre."</p>

<p>"The Convention will surely declare him under
arrest."</p>

<p>"If he falls, the executions will stop."</p>

<p>"I say the trial ought to stop until we see."</p>

<p>"Yes, postpone the trial."</p>

<p>"What! There are traitors, then, in the
room!" cried Fouquier, who, the better to see,
had mounted a step. Before his threatening
glance the movement of clemency died away.
Again was heard the monotonous voice of the
clerk intoning the roll and the listless responses of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>the accused. In the stand one of the jury impatiently
pulled out a watch, another stifled a
yawn.</p>

<p>All at once there was a craning of heads. An
interruption had come; the voice of the young
boy was protesting:</p>

<p>"Citoyen, the accusation is for my brother. I
am not twenty-six. I have done nothing against
the Republic. Citoyen, I am sixteen. I have my
papers to prove it."</p>

<p>A greffier nodded his head in confirmation,
and extended a handful of papers toward the
judge, saying:</p>

<p>"Citoyen, he speaks the truth."</p>

<p>Murmurs ran through the crowd:</p>

<p>"It's a mistake!"</p>

<p>"He's a child!"</p>

<p>"Release him!"</p>

<p>On the judges' bench the figure of Dumas
arose.</p>

<p>"And if you are only sixteen," he cried brutally,
"in the matter of crime you are fully
eighty." Then, with a furious gesture, he added:
"Pass on, and make haste!"</p>

<p>The murmur of revolt from the audience
was overwhelmed in a sudden roar of astonishment.
Dumas had been arrested! The counter-revolution
had come! Those who had not
seen the arrest cried:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>
<p>"But what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Tell us! Tell us!"</p>

<p>Others answered:</p>

<p>"Dumas!"</p>

<p>"Arrested!"</p>

<p>"The counter-revolution has come!"</p>

<p>A voice cried:</p>

<p>"The quartiers are in arms!"</p>

<p>"True?"</p>

<p>"The tocsin is ringing!"</p>

<p>"They'll make an end of Robespierre?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"It's true! Haven't they arrested Dumas?"</p>

<p>"Suspend the trial!"</p>

<p>"Mercy! Clemency!"</p>

<p>All eyes turned to Fouquier, who answered
contemptuously and stubbornly:</p>

<p>"Justice must take its course!"</p>

<p>At Dossonville's side the blacksmith, with the
sudden frenzy of prophecy, cried:</p>

<p>"Fouquier, beware! The guillotine is waiting
for you!"</p>

<p>While with brawny shoulders he wriggled free
of the willing crowd, Dossonville looked for the
hundredth time at Nicole. She had not abandoned
her calm; only a slight frown told of the
havoc the sudden opening and closing of the gates
of hope played in her soul.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>
<p>Another judge replaced Dumas. The roll-call
was hurried on. Twice Fouquier sent a physician
to report the condition of the woman in the witness-room.
A flutter of the eyelids would have
meant death. She remained in a stupor, and was
at last sent to the hospital. The roll-call ended.
The jury, after the farce of declaring that they
had heard sufficient evidence, retired to deliberate
upon the guilt of the twenty-six. They returned
shortly. It was late, and many suffered from the
postponement of the luncheon-hour. One man
acquitted&mdash;Aviot Turot, laborer.</p>

<p>A shudder passed through the body of Dossonville,
and a groan escaped his lips. The fatal,
inevitable word "Guilty" overwhelmed him.
Nicole heard it with a smile&mdash;sad, yet satisfied.</p>

<p>Another stir, and a buzz of comments rose as
the executioner entered and began to converse
with Fouquier. Those in front, who could hear,
called back:</p>

<p>"Sanson is remonstrating."</p>

<p>"Sanson wants the execution deferred."</p>

<p>"He says the city is rising."</p>

<p>A last time Fouquier refused to budge, and,
crossing his arms, reiterated bluntly, to be heard
by all:</p>

<p>"No, no! I say no! Justice must take its
course."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>
<p>The condemned, who had paused as they had
risen trembling with hope, filed out, while the
crowd in the court-room surged forth to meet the
tumbrels.</p>

<p>Dossonville, using his privilege of agent de
sûreté, entered the prison, seeking Nicole in the
crowd of prisoners massed in the outer hall;
threading through anxious groups, who whispered:</p>

<p>"You saw Dumas arrested?"</p>

<p>"They say there is a revolt against Robespierre."</p>

<p>"The people seemed to sympathize with us."</p>

<p>Others, scorning to hang their hopes on desperate
chances, waited stoically or reverently the
summons to the tumbrels. A young aristocrat
was whistling defiantly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, Richard, oh, mon roi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;L'univers t'abandonne!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In another group, guarding their enmity to the
end, two brothers of the people retorted with the
"Marseillaise."</p>

<p>Two women near Dossonville were chatting
gaily:</p>

<p>"I am so pale those cursed revolutionists will
think that I am afraid."</p>

<p>"You must not give them that satisfaction."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>
<p>"I do seem pale, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah, then I must rouge!"</p>

<p>Dossonville examined the figure of the graceful
woman, who was gaily daubing her cheeks,
and recognized the famous Duchess of M&mdash;&mdash;.
At this moment, in the obscurity of the arches,
he discovered at last the blue dress and golden
hair of Nicole.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is you," she cried joyfully. "I had
hoped you could see me."</p>

<p>"Nicole," he said bitterly, "this is your
doing."</p>

<p>Her manner changed; she grew serious.</p>

<p>"My friend," she said, "I have but done what
I wished. I am happy." She held up her finger
with Barabant's ring on it. "You see, I am his
wife, and I have saved him."</p>

<p>The outward movement toward the tumbrels
had begun. From the doorway the guards repeated:</p>

<p>"Hurry up, there; hurry up, you cursed aristocrats!"</p>

<p>Dossonville kissed her with more feeling than
he had believed possible, and said, through the
tears that clouded his eyes, "I would have saved
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not grieve," she said, touched by his sorrow.
She took her scarf and put it into his
hand, saying: "Give it to him. Tell him that I
am happy&mdash;that it is best so. Adieu!"</p>

<p>Then, as though fearing to lose her self-control,
she pressed his hand and hurried away.</p>

<p>Dossonville, passing out by a side entrance,
hastened to meet the slow procession across the
river. The city was in uproar; over the roofs
the bells were crying the civil strife, while every
street seemed to give forth the thunder of drums.
Masses of volunteers, without formation or leader,
swept the boulevards, while the air was charged
with the conflict of shouts:</p>

<p>"Vive la Commune!"</p>

<p>"À bas les Jacobins!"</p>

<p>"Vive Robespierre!"</p>

<p>"Robespierre à la Guillotine!"</p>

<p>The chariots crossed from the gates of the
Conciergerie, acclaimed by the hoots and jeers
of the daily hordes of mad women who gathered
to shriek their foul abuse and frantic revilings.
But as the tumbrels passed the river the insults
ceased, replaced by murmurs of sympathy.</p>

<p>In the third chariot Dossonville found Nicole.
The duchess, with her brilliant cheeks, was on
the same bench, and between the two women
the boy, his hand in Nicole's.</p>

<p>From the direction of the Convention came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>wild rumors of Robespierre's defeat. The crowd,
increasing, began to cry:</p>

<p>"Enough blood!"</p>

<p>"No more blood!"</p>

<p>"Pity on the condemned!"</p>

<p>Dossonville, hardly daring to hope, noticed that
Sanson examined the crowd anxiously&mdash;a not unfriendly
glance. The demonstration continued,
growing bolder, a hundred voices insisting:</p>

<p>"Enough blood!"</p>

<p>"No more victims!"</p>

<p>"Stop the massacre!"</p>

<p>Among the prisoners several, unable to resist
the sudden leap of hope to their eyes, stretched
out their hands, crying:</p>

<p>"We are innocent!"</p>

<p>In the first chariot Cramoisin, in a frenzy, was
shouting:</p>

<p>"Citoyens, do not mistake me. I am a republican.
Vive la République! Save me, at
least!"</p>

<p>Nicole was speaking to the boy; for the new
vision of life had made him tremble. Amid
the leaping floods of humanity she remained
calm, a certain maternal sweetness and repose
enveloping her as she sought to fortify the resolution
of her companion. To Dossonville,
through the rising storm of sound and swaying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>of bodies, a lull of peace seemed to surround her
and to remove her from the frenzy.</p>

<p>Again the revolt rose in him that she should
die thus. Perceiving all at once that the crowd
had pressed about the carts until their progress
was impeded, he flung himself into the swirl,
exhorting and encouraging. The cries redoubled,
becoming more threatening:</p>

<p>"Save them!"</p>

<p>"Enough butchery!"</p>

<p>"On, comrades! Save them!"</p>

<p>"Aye, deliver them!"</p>

<p>"Stop the chariots!"</p>

<p>"Unhitch the horses! Unhitch the horses!"</p>

<p>At this last, the cry of Dossonville, the multitude,
with a shriek of triumph, surged up against
the tumbrels. A hundred hands checked the
horses, reaching out for the buckles of the harness,
while a dozen voices cried:</p>

<p>"Courage! We'll release you!"</p>

<p>Already the prisoners exclaimed joyfully, already
Dossonville stretched out his arms to
Nicole, when a cry of fear and despair burst from
the rescuers, voiced in the dreaded name:</p>

<p>"Henriot! Henriot!"</p>

<p>Up the street, at the head of his dragoons,
sabres flashing in the air, break-a-neck came the
wild figure of the Jacobin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>
<p>The surge of the fleeing crowd held Dossonville
a moment against the tumbrel, where he
heard through the confusion a cry of despair from
the boy, "I could have borne anything but hope!"
Then, as Dossonville was swept away, he saw the
child's head fall upon the shoulder of Nicole.
The next moment he was buffeted and hurled
aside; then a horse struck him and flung him to
the ground, where a dozen feet trampled him.
Stunned, covered with dirt, and bleeding, he
stumbled to his feet. The tumbrels, surrounded
by cavalry, were disappearing in the distance,
moving swiftly. He ran after them, shaking his
helpless fist, and as he turned the corner, a groan
burst from him. Over the heads of the people
the twin shafts of the guillotine sprang into view.</p>

<p>Numb and half unconscious, seeing only, in the
third cart, the distant blot of blue, he limped on,
following as best he could into the square. He
fought his way to the front, beside the cordon of
naked swords that girdled the scaffold, repeating
to himself a hundred times:</p>

<p>"I must not stay! I will not stay!"</p>

<p>But still the pitiful hope of a deliverance held
him there, to snatch at every message of the air
that floated over the distracted city. One after
another the condemned mounted the steps and
passed across the stage like phantoms, hurried on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>by the remorseless Jacobin, while those about
him cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, for two hours&mdash;for one!"</p>

<p>"Cursed Henriot, we could have saved them!"</p>

<p>"Why does the Convention delay?"</p>

<p>"Ah, the monster! He is afraid to lose a
single one!"</p>

<p>She came at last, a patch of blue, a white face
against the stretch of heads. She saw him not at
all, nor any one. The maternal instinct of the
woman that had raised her above her companions
on the journey was gone, and with it all consciousness
of the world and the sorrows and the
responsibilities which had so transformed her.
Only once did she notice her surroundings, when
the bourreau, with impatient hand, bared her
throat. Then for a moment her hands went
instinctively to cover herself from the multitude.
Almost immediately her face became grave and
reverent. The assistants advanced to take her to
the guillotine. Then with a rapid motion she
made the sign of the cross, raising her eyes to the
deep sky, as though already she saw beyond the
grave,&mdash;the timid question of a child who hesitates
in wonder before the incomprehensible.</p>

<p>With a sob, Dossonville turned, shrinking from
the sight of the mutilating knife, and waited with
averted face.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>
<p>There was a vast moment, then a shock of
steel, and a woman who had seen his tears whispered:</p>

<p>"It is over!"</p>

<p>Then, fleeing from the inexorable machine, he
plunged, weeping, through the crowd, stumbling
aimlessly on into the frantic city, where, too late,
every street was echoing to the fear-releasing
shrieks of rejoicing:</p>

<p>"Robespierre is fallen!"</p>

<p>"The Terror is ended!"</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>



<h2><small>EPILOGUE</small></h2>


<p>An hour later Dossonville was arrested, thanks
to his political somersault, which had
brought him twenty denunciations before the
Committee of Safety as having always spoken ill
of the Jacobins and defamed the character of
Robespierre. The accusation of a day served to
cleanse the record of months.</p>

<p>Imprisoned for a few months at the Maison
Talaru, he gained the frontier at a favorable
moment and embarked for South America.
Then for ten years, at sea or in the colonies, he
was buffeted from continent to continent, always
embroiled, always running on the lead of adventure,
which he called his one bad habit.</p>

<p>When he again saw Paris, the Empire was at
its crest. The city he had left a wilderness had
flowered with the riotous luxuriance of the tropics.
The Tuileries Gardens were again noisy with the
laughter of promenaders, thronging to a review
in the Place du Carrousel. Wherever he went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>his eye caught the flash of martial splendor and
the sheen of sabers.</p>

<p>A little sadly he spent the days in the strange
Babylon, seeking some trace of the great Revolution
that once had rolled through the city, of the
thundering mobs, the fervid cafés, the tricoteuses,
and the creak of the roiling tumbrels.</p>

<p>The Cabaret of the Prêtre Pendu, its gibbet banished,
had become the Cabaret of a Hundred and
One Victories. The greeting of "citoyen" no
longer resounded in the street. Of all the familiar
faces in the Rue Maugout, not one confronted
him. La Mère Corniche had been replaced by
another concierge, bent and wrinkled after the
manner of concierges, as though her life had been
passed at her post.</p>

<p>Among the counts and barons, marshals and
princes, of the Empire, galloping in glory, shouting
frantically "Vive l'Empereur!" Dossonville recognized
with bewilderment figures of Jacobins and
Girondins, once worshipers of the sacred Republic.
He sought out the Maison Talaru; lackeys were
lounging before the door and a stream of carriages
rolling through the restored porte-cochère.
Once, hearing the rumor of a great execution for
the afternoon, with a revival of interest he asked
a passer-by:</p>

<p>"And the executioner, what do you call him?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sanson."</p>

<p>"Charles Sanson?"</p>

<p>"His son."</p>

<p>Recalling the prophecy of the father, indifferent
servitor to republic or kingdom, he returned
pensively to the boulevards, where, to rid himself
of black memories, he selected among the pomp
and the glitter a fashionable café, and installed
himself.</p>

<p>Presently, reviewing idly the gorgeous clientele,
his eye rested on a knot of generals. The
figure of the speaker caught his memory by a
certain trick of exuberant gesture that recalled
a comrade of other days. Calling a waiter, he
demanded:</p>

<p>"That man over there, decorated with medals
and laughing, in that cluster of fighters, do you
see him?"</p>

<p>"The Baron de Ricordo&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"The Baron de Ricordo; a great man in the
Senate, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought he resembled some one else.
Thanks."</p>

<p>Almost immediately, dissatisfied, he recalled
him.</p>

<p>"And his family name? Find that out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>"Monsieur, he is a Barabant, of the well-known
Barabants of the Midi. The family is
honorable and old. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind. Ah, one thing more. Is he
married? Tell me that."</p>

<p>"Monsieur, he marries this month,&mdash;a great
marriage."</p>

<p>"Enough. That's sufficient."</p>

<p>At this moment the party pushed back their
chairs and came straggling toward him.</p>

<p>"When you're young all folly's possible,"
said the voice of Barabant at his elbow.</p>

<p>"It's a wonder, I say, that we survive to middle
age."</p>

<p>"Dame, yes!" replied the baron. "Will you
believe it of me&mdash;at twenty-five I wept because
I could not die for an idea!"</p>

<p>Dossonville, who was on the point of rising,
fell back and lowered his head. The resplendent
group swaggered down to the sidewalk, where
presently a magnificent equipage rolled up, a
lady extended her hand to the Baron de Ricordo,
who, nodding to his comrades, sprang into the
carriage and drove off.</p>

<p>Pushing back the untasted glass, Dossonville
rang for his bill.</p>

<p>"Monsieur doesn't take his drink," the garçon
objected.</p>

<p>Dossonville, looking down, saw that it was true.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>
<p>"There is something the matter, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Monsieur complains&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, I have looked at the bottom of the glass,
my friend," he answered; but his glance was in
the street. "When one drinks one should never
do that."</p>

<p>Leaving the perplexed garçon to turn over his
words, he sauntered among the thronged tables,
and joining the slow procession of the promenaders,
was swept gradually away.</p>
